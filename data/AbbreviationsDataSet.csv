FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|202|205|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|At the conclusion of our discussion, the patient elected to schedule an appointment for amniocentesis for Wednesday, _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. The patient declined preliminary chromosome results through FISH studies and stated that she wished to just wished to be informed of the final chromosome results as well as amniotic fluid AFP.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH.|157|161|HOSPITAL COURSE|Immunophenotyping was negative for leukemia. Her bone marrow RFLP showed 100% donor #1. Cytogenetics with BCR/ABL showed 0/400 or 0% negative for BCR/ABL by FISH. Molecular diagnostics BCR/ABL shows a suspicion for BCR/ABL transcripts of minor breakpoint of ALL type. This was discussed with the attending physician and the decision was made to concentrate on patient's other serious health issues and the patient would be put on desatinib at a later date.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|260|263|RECOMMENDATIONS|These test results, in conjunction with a heart defect that is very characteristic of Down syndrome, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of fetal Down syndrome. We did discuss some of the limitations of FISH testing, and the importance of always following up FISH with a full cytogenetic study. The final results of _%#NAME#%_'s amniocentesis should be available some time next week. We spent some time discussing the prognosis and variability for a child with Down syndrome.

However, PR was negative and did not show any HER-2-neu amplification by FISH. The patient underwent oncotype DX since her progesterone receptor was negative which showed high value and decided to receive chemotherapy.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|252|255|IMPRESSION|Dear Dr. _%#NAME#%_: I am writing to notify you of results of your patient, _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_'s genetic amniocentesis, performed on _%#MMDD2004#%_. According to F-UMC Cytogenic Laboratory, amniotic fluid chromosomes were normal, 46 XY. In addition FISH analysis was performed with normal signals for chromosome 13, 18, and 21, X and Y. The amniotic fluid alpha fetoprotein was 1.33 MoM which is in the normal range, as reported by the Foundation for Blood Research.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|232|235|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|Needle biopsy revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma grade II. It was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive. She had an additional core from another lesion, which was also of similar histology. She did undergo HER2 analysis by FISH and this turned out to be negative. PET CT scan was done on _%#MMDD2007#%_ at University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, which showed several soft tissue nodules in the left breast.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|145|148|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|While the pattern was suggestive of Down syndrome, none of the individual markers was strikingly abnormal (i.e. the NT was still below 95%tile). FISH for common aneuploidies (i.e. Down syndrome, trisomy 13, trisomy 18) was reported as normal on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. I was contacted by the cytogenetics lab on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, and informed that a marker chromosome was detected in the sample.

Chromosomes were obtained, with particular notice request for a FISH test to detect possible 22 q deletion. At the time of discharge, chromosomal tests are still pending. An MRI of the head was obtained on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, which was normal.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|223|226|SUBJECTIVE|_%#NAME#%_ was a 33-week product of a pregnancy that was complicated by known intrauterine growth retardation, microcephali, and evidence of fetal bowel obstruction with small kidney size. Initial karyotype studies done by FISH analysis only showed a 46XX karyotype. At delivery she clearly had significant anomalies with bilateral microphthalmia, severe microcephali, and severe growth retardation with a birth weight of 1630 grams.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|272|275|IN SUMMARY|In addition, given the concerns by ultrasound the availability of pregnancy continuation and pregnancy termination was discussed briefly with the family. At the conclusion of our discussion the patient elected to proceed with an amniocentesis. Amniotic fluid was sent for FISH studies as well as chromosome studies and amniotic fluid AFP. The patient will be called with the results as soon as they become available.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|163|166|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Unfortunately, a follow-up bone marrow biopsy on _%#MMDD2003#%_ (UHH03- 1258) revealed moderate granulopoiesis and a erythroid megakaryocytosis hypoplasia and the FISH was negative for chromosomal abnormalities or evidence of monosomy 7. But, the follow-up bone marrow on _%#MMDD2003#%_ (UHH03-1411) revealed early relapse or possible development of myelodysplastic syndrome.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH.|210|214|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|A bone marrow biopsy on _%#MMDD2005#%_ revealed 5% blasts. The cytogenetic abnormalities were still present by FISH.

This value is within the range of normal for our laboratory.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH.|258|262|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|The patient had no symptoms prior to her cerclage. Ultrasound was performed at the perinatology center to evaluate known omphalocele in the infant. Amniocentesis at that time was performed which ruled out an infection, and cytogenetics demonstrated a normal FISH. The patient presented at the time of her admission with episodic low back pain since the evening of _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. Each episode lasted approximately one minute. The patient denied any leaking fluid or vaginal bleeding.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH.|160|164|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|She had some DCIS. Thus she was a stage III-A. She was estrogen receptor positive at 18%, progesterone receptor negative at 3.7%, and HER-2/neu was negative by FISH. The patient had a right breast tumor resected and that breast had two tumors. The patient's right breast had two sentinel lymph nodes that were normal.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|224|227|G 4   P 3003				LMP|An amniocentesis was performed that day, in which FISH studies were performed to obtain some preliminary information. According to Fairview-University Medical Center Cytogenic Laboratory, 93% of interphase cells examined by FISH had three signals for chromosome 21, and thus is consistent with trisomy 21. Final chromosome analysis is pending. I reviewed features of babies with Down syndrome, including varying degrees of mental retardation, increased risk for congenital heart defect, and characteristic facial features.
FISH|GENERAL ENGLISH|FISH,|157|161|ALTHOUGH HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS OR ANY|The patient's only other complaint at this time is some pruritis over her face and chest. No rash is currently visible. She DOES HAVE KNOWN ALLERGY TO SHELL FISH, ALTHOUGH HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS OR ANY IODINATED MATERIALS SO FAR TODAY. However, she did undergo a bed bath earlier shortly after which the pruritis started.

MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|213|215|ASSESSMENT|The patient is hemodynamically stable. 2. Alpha hemolytic strep detected per right knee aspirate _%#MMDD2007#%_. 3. History of chronic heart murmur with an echocardiogram several years ago revealing mild AI, mild MR, and no aortic stenosis. 4. No known coronary artery disease. 5. Hyperlipidemia. RECOMMENDATIONS: Routine postoperative labs will be obtained.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|139|140|BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Echo on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, revealed severe mitral regurgitation and an EF of 35%. Previous echos were noted to have mild to moderate MR and normal EF. The patient was admitted for heart failure management and evaluation for mitral valve replacement. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Mitral valve regurgitation diagnosed 2 years ago.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|297|299|HOSPITAL COURSE|She also had bilateral carotid Dopplers which showed less than 50% diameter stenosis of both internal carotid arteries and an echocardiogram done during this admission was also within normal limits with a normal ejection fraction of 60-65%, trace to mild AI with minimally sclerotic valves, trace MR, trace TR and trace PR. No clots were noted within the atrial chamber. The right ventricular systolic pressure was slightly elevated consistent with mild pulmonary hypertension.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|316|317|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|This was followed up with an MRI of the brain, which on diffusion-weighted imaging revealed lesions in the right frontal lobe and right temporal lobe in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. These were felt to be compatible with acute infarct and distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. An MR angiogram demonstrated occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery as well, but decreased flow to the anterior branch of the middle cerebral artery and stenosis at the genu of the right middle cerebral artery.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|477|478|ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS|ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Oligodendrogliomas. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Oligodendrogliomas. OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED: MRI-guided biopsy of the right parietal lesion. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this is a 52-year-old female with a history of oligodendroglioma diagnosed several years ago demonstrated some minor growth on MR scan and as such she had a treatment with radiation and Temodar, but there was some question of increased change in this lesion on her most recent MR which was possibly suggestive of ongoing treatment effect, but the increase in size of the tissue itself caused difficulty with seizure management.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|246|247|IMAGING STUDIES|IMAGING STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray obtained _%#MMDD2002#%_ results: Mildly elevated cardiac silhouette unchanged from previous study. Questionable cephalization consistent with early heart failure, poor inspiratory effort, no infiltrate. 2. Cardiac MR results: No evidence of infiltration. Ejection fraction estimated at 43%. Possible wall motion abnormality in the anterior lateral wall. HOSPITAL COURSE: Briefly, this is a 24-year-old male with a past medical history of tuberous sclerosis who presents with several day history of chest pain.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|122|123|SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE|She drove in to see me the next day and my neuro exam was unremarkable. In the course of setting up an outpatient EEG and MR scan of her brain, she had another episode. I witnessed the episode and found that she had a regular pulse and her blood pressure was a bit elevated in the range of 180/90, and her blood sugar was 161.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|240|241|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY|At present, she is feeling well other than weak. She is not nauseated and denies any headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, diarrhea, or bladder symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Left carotid endarterectomy _%#MM2000#%_. MR angiogram showed an 80% stenosis prior to surgery. 2. Cerebrovascular accident _%#MM1998#%_, resulting in right sided weakness and aphasia. A CT scan showed a large left frontal/parietal infarct. She was treated with Coumadin.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|199|200|IMPRESSION|MRI does not show any evidence of diffusion weighted abnormalities to suggest stroke or TIA. 2. Evidence of high-grade ICA stenosis, versus near occlusion, versus occlusion. The patient needs formal MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis for further assessment. RECOMMENDATIONS: Proceed with MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis while patient in the Emergency Room and make further decision about treatment.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|257|259|PROCEDURES AND INVESTIGATIONS|3. Hypertension. 4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 5. Depression. 6. Osteoporosis. 7. Hyperlipidemia. PROCEDURES AND INVESTIGATIONS: 1. Transthoracic echocardiogram which showed abnormal ejection fraction, severe left atrial enlargement, mild-to-moderate MR, moderate mitral annular calcification, mild-to-moderate right atrial dilatation, moderate TR and RV systolic pressure 44 mmHg above right atrial pressure.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|176|177|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Dr. _%#NAME#%_ ordered an MRI of the brain with an MR angiogram of the circle of Willis. I did review the MRI of the brain and I do not see any evidence of any acute ischemia. MR angiogram has also some normal variants of the circle of Willis, but I do not see any major branch artery occlusion or any aneurysms.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|163|164|DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS|A carotid ultrasound was performed showing less than 40% stenosis in both carotid artery distributions. The MR angiogram of the neck was essentially unremarkable. MR angiography of the head was also normal. However an MRI scan of the cervical spine showed a recent infarct o the right side of the pons as well as a nonenhancing mass lesion on the right side of the cervical spinal cord at the C2-3 level, etiology indeterminate.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|179|180|IMPRESSION|This was followed up with an MR angiogram and MRI of the brain. The brain appeared normal on diffusion, flare and T2 images. No cortical lesions were identified. The intracranial MR angiogram was normal with the exception of a tiny anterior communicating artery aneurysm (1mm). The MR angiogram of the neck revealed an 80-90% right internal carotid artery stenosis, severe disease of the origin of the right external carotid and 40-50% of the proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|202|203|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY|6. Left total knee arthroplasty. 7. History of TIA: The patient had an MRI/MRA on _%#MMDD2002#%_ which showed mild small vessel ischemic-type changes with no evidence of stroke. The patient also had an MR of the spine which showed mild diffuse degenerative changes. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother had a stroke at 62 years old, and the patient's sister had a stroke as well.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR.|196|198|INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION|White count was 21,000, hemoglobin 14.3 grams. There was trace elevation of the troponin. This led to an echocardiogram being done which showed well preserved LV systolic function. No significant MR. The left atrium was difficult to see. The right ventricle was hypokinetic and dilated and the right atrium was dilated with mild TR.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|130|131|HISTORY|HISTORY: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 65-year-old diabetic who has developed a nonhealing ulceration of his left 4th-5th web space. MR angiogram revealed occlusion of the trifurcation vessels with a probable reconstituted distal anterior tibial and posterior tibial artery. It was felt that revascularization was indicated. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on _%#MMDD2005#%_ where, under a spinal anesthetic, a left above-knee popliteal to distal anterior tibial nonreversed vein bypass graft was performed.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|319|320|HOSPITAL COURSE|HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Non Q-wave MI/Coronary vasospasm. The patient was admitted with a bump in her troponin, and there was concern for an ongoing .....type of angina. She was placed on a heparin/nitro drip. She underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated normal left ventricular systolic function with trace MR and TR with an estimated ejection fraction of 60 to 65%. On hospital day #1 she continued to complain of persistent ongoing chest pain despite the heparin/nitro drip.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|210|211|HOSPITAL COURSE|MRI scanning of the brain was subsequently performed disclosing evidence of a moderate to large nonhemorrhagic infarct, both in the left posterior frontal and left parietal lobe. His left carotid artery on the MR angiogram revealed either very proximal high-grade stenosis or more likely occlusion. 80-90% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery was also identified.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|357|358|IMPRESSION|IMPRESSION: This gentleman presents with new onset of neurological deficits with some progression over the course of 24 hours, most likely given the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, his presentation is consistent with lacunar stroke in the right deep hemisphere or right brain stem. At this point, he is going for MRI of the brain, I also would add MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis. I would like also to see echocardiogram which was also ordered by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. I think we also should proceed with stroke workup in a young adult, given his young age, which would include coagulopathy workup and homocysteine level.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|127|128|IMPRESSION|I did speak with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ of Interventional Radiology. He wants us to pursue an emergent MRI of the brain and MR angiogram both of the neck and intracranial vessels. If she does have a large vessel occlusion, he discussed intra-atrial TPA.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|206|207|LUNGS|CARDIOVASCULAR: The apex lies in the 6th intercostal space outside the midclavicular line. It is a dyskinetic apex. There is a pa nsystolic murmur in the mitral area and in the tricuspid area suggestive of MR and TR. There is moderate pulmonary hypertension as noted by a diastolic shock. The P2 is loud. LUNGS: The air entry is diminished bilaterally in the bases.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|370|371|RECOMMENDATIONS|RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient has been loaded with fosphenytoin. I agree with that and will also recommend continuing with maintenance Dilantin which the care continued at 300 mg per day. Both free and bound phenytoin levels will be checked. As to further evaluation of the infarct, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and diffusion-weighted imaging as well as MR angiogram of the circle of Willis and cervical vessels will be checked. In addition, an echocardiogram will be checked. He will be maintained on aspirin at the present time.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|162|163|PLAN|Follow lipase. He may need an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at some point to make sure he does not have a duplicated duct. He has had a previous MR cholangiogram and a CT scan showing the early pseudocyst formation. This may need to be followed also. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ will follow in the hospital.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR.|146|148|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|3. LV gram with moderate degree of LV dysfunction with an EF of 30%. 4. End diastolic pressures substantially elevated at 27. 5. Mild to moderate MR. The patient has had chest pain for 18 years. He says this occurs about one time a week to one time every four weeks.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|168|169|DISCUSSION|I believe she may need a TEE, but if they just do mitral valve replacement, it should not be necessary. She may need another transthoracic echocardiogram to see if her MR has worsened, but I believe cardiac catheterization is the place to start. I have reviewed the risks and benefits, including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, dye reaction, urgent surgery, etc., she understands and agrees to proceed.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|174|175|NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION|I agree with the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. I will look at other possible causes such as a bilateral L4 radiculopathy. I doubt that is the case, however, given her MR scan findings. In addition, the possibility of a more diffuse myositis will be evaluated. The recommendations at this time will be to proceed with CK, aldolase, and thyroid functions.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|276|277|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|There was evidence of precordial and azygoesophageal lymphadenopathy. Surgical pathology report (UHC 02-00813) revealed no evidence of malignancy. CT scan of the head was performed on _%#MMDD2002#%_ and it showed mild small-vessel ischemic disease. No evidence of metastases. MR scan performed the following day on _%#MMDD2002#%_ revealed no evidence of metastases. PET scan performed on _%#MMDD2002#%_ showed nodular focus of increased tracer uptake within the right lower lobe correlating with a nodule seen on prior CT.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|276|277|HOSPITAL COURSE|The patient cleared her neurological symptoms in the Emergency Department and was felt to have normal neurological examination by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. He ordered MRI/MRA, carotid ultrasound, echocardiogram. Echocardiogram preliminary report showed normal EF estimated at 55%, 1-2+ MR otherwise unremarkable. Of note, a formal cardiology read has not been performed. She had carotid ultrasound which was performed earlier, but is not officially red by radiology.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|335|337|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY|2. Congestive type heart failure _%#MM2005#%_ due to high output. 3. Severe AS. Cardiac echo done _%#MM2005#%_ showed the following, mild biatrial enlargement, RV mildly dilated and mildly dysfunctional, RV mild concentric LVH with moderate global hypokinesis with the apex having worse contractility with an EF of 40%, trace TR, mild MR, aortic valve heavily calcified with aortic valve area 0.7 cm2, with a maximum gradient of 61 mmHg and a mean gradient of 42.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|139|140|CONSULTATIONS|2. MRA of the head which was limited secondary to the patient's motion and therefore difficult to exclude intracranial stenosis but normal MR angiogram. 3. CT of the chest showed marked elevation of the right diaphragm with bibasilar atelectasis, greater on the right than the left.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|156|157|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Prior to admission he did not have any significant headaches, nausea or vomiting, no other complaints of motor or sensory changes. In the Emergency Room an MR scan showed areas suggestive of acute, subacute and chronic ischemic changes and on MRA, there was a suggestion for possible vasculitis.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|266|268|HOSPITAL COURSE|Her anoxic encephalopathy resolved fairly rapidly, and she was studied with echocardiography, revealing severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 37 mm and a peak gradient of 64 mm, and an estimated aortic valve area of 0.64 cm. She had mild-to-moderate TR and MR, and trace AI. Ejection fraction was judged to be 45-50%. She underwent coronary angiography, revealing mild-to-moderate left main disease, an ostial 90% circumflex stenosis, and mild LAD disease, but with an aneurysm at the junction of the LAD and intermediate branch.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|278|280|PROCEDURES DONE DURING PRESENT ADMISSION|Pancreas is normal. Normal sized kidneys. 5. Echocardiogram (_%#MMDD2002#%_). Indications were that the patient had known coronary artery disease, status post for amylase.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43-year-old Caucasian woman with longstanding history of peripheral vascular disease and hypercoagulable state.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|197|198|DISCUSSION|He is admitted after recent laboratory studies were obtained in the clinic after he presented with symptoms of a two week history of left hip pain. Apparently a plane film was negative and further MR scan may have been done on an outpatient basis, results of which we are not clear on. In the meantime, he had blood work done at the clinic and was told to come for hospitalization because of a potassium of about 6 and an elevated creatinine.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|140|141|ALLERGIES|Her BNP was 435. A transthoracic echo which was performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, showed an LVEF of 60%, postoperative. She had 2 to 3+ MR and TR. Her RV systolic pressure was 61+ RA. She had bilateral atrial enlargement. Results of the right heart catheterization have been dictated above.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|262|263|ASSESSMENT|Skeletal system: He has high arches. ASSESSMENT: I think the MR finding represents a benign, incidental finding, which may simply represent a prominent perivascular space. PLAN: I do not think that he needs any further neurologic assessment or evaluation of the MR finding. His headache I think is a benign headache. He may be predisposed to it by somewhat the increased muscle tone.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|214|216|DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS|His children are in Michigan, and he is very adamant about not going to the nursing home like his wife has been. While he was here, he had an echo done with severe diffuse hypokinesis, several walls involved, mild MR, TR, AI, and PI. RV septum severely hypokinetic. Estimated LV ejection fraction was 20-25%. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had come in after calling 911, and he was noted to have increasing troponins.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|308|310|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|The patient's initial echo showed an EF of 15% to 20%, anterior septal hypokinesis to akinesis, apical akinesis, mild MR, moderate TR, estimated PA systolic function was 36, LVIDD was 4.8 cm. Subsequent echoes on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, showed an EF of 20% to 25%, anterior septal and apical akinesis, mild MR, only contractile portion was the left base. Normal LV size. Tissue Doppler on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, showed mild LV desynchrony of the QRS in the 70s.
MR|myocardial infarction:MI|MR.|122|124|HOSPITAL COURSE|On the day of admission he had severe chest pressure which quite frightened him and brought him here. He ruled out for an MR. His initial cardiac echo was normal and his EKG was normal. He did have a couple of very mild episodes of his chest pressure.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|178|179|CONSULTATIONS|4. An MR of the neck: No significant stenosis identified in either carotid system. Apparent stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery, probably due to an artifact. 5. MR angiogram of the head negative. 6. MRI of the head: No acute pathology, no bleed or mass or acute infarct seen.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|170|171|ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS|Given that she has a single kidney, she would be particularly prone to development of hypertension if she has a single renal artery. This could be evaluated further with MR angiography.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|274|276|PROCEDURES PERFORMED|DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Transthoracic echocardiogram on _%#MMDD2003#%_, showing diffuse hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%, pulmonary artery pressure of 52, plus right atrial pressure, mild left ventricular dilatation, mild MR, mild left atrial enlargement, mild right atrial enlargement, and trace tricuspid regurgitation. 2. Coronary angiography on _%#MMDD2003#%_, showing a left main with 25% stenosis lesion of circumflex, which was occluded, and right coronary artery that showed in-stent restenosis with a lesion of 75% to 90%.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|138|139||_%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, age 40, was admitted with a history of moderately severe mitral insufficiency, EF of 45-50% and concerned that his MR was causing worsening symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion. He was assessed and evaluated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ who recommended mitral valve repair.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|174|175|SUMMARY|At the present time, I would recommend continuing him on aspirin. Workup will include MRI of the brain to document the distribution of the stroke as well as the extent. Also MR angiography of the circle of Willis will be checked. Duplex carotid ultrasound will be checked as well. Further management depends on the outcome of the above studies.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|175|176|SURGICAL INDICATIONS|SURGICAL INDICATIONS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 52-year-old female who recently was admitted with a bout of right upper quadrant pain. She was found to have abnormal LFT and MR cholangiogram showed a large stone in the common duct. She did have ERCP and sphincterotomy with extraction of a large stone.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|151|152|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Since he had been in the emergency room, his blood pressure is 126/76, pulse 70 and regular. He is afebrile. He did have an MRI scan of the brain with MR angiogram of circle of Willis. I personally reviewed the films and discussed them with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. They do not show any evidence of stroke. On diffusion weighted image there is no evidence of abnormalities on the T2 signal images.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|148|150|PROCEDURES PERFORMED|ADMISSION/DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cardiac echo, which showed EF of 55%, diastolic dysfunction, mild MR, moderate TR, mildly dilated left ventricular and left atrium, unchanged from previous echos. 2. Upper extremity doppler ultrasound, which did not show any evidence for deep venous thrombosis or any arterial flow impairment.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|243|244|HOSPITAL COURSE|Further stroke work-up was done including carotid ultrasound which showed minimal plaque disease at both carotid bifurcations. She also underwent an echocardiogram which showed left ventricular systolic function which was normal. She had mild MR and mild TR. She had some early diastolic dysfunction as well as biatrial enlargement. The patient was seen by physical therapy and had slow improvement and strength in her right lower extremity.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|178|179|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY|She has chronic mid to upper back discomfort. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Syncope, _%#MM2003#%_. Evaluation included, I believe, a negative stress test, unremarkable event monitor, MR angiogram of the brain showing some small vessel changes and a negative carotid ultrasound. She did not have electrophysiologic study at that time.
MR|GENERAL ENGLISH|MR.|113|115|CURRENT MEDICATIONS|MEDICATION ALLERGIES: HE REPORTED AN ALLERGY TO SULFA. HE WAS UNABLE TO TOLERATE CARVEDILOL DUE TO SIDE EFFECTS. MR. _%#NAME#%_ INSISTS HE IS UNABLE TO TAKE TOPROL XL SINCE HIS DIABETES MELLITUS WAS UNCONTROLLABLE WHILE HE WAS ON THIS FORM OF METOPROLOL AS A RESULT HE HAS BEEN TAKING LOPRESSOR AT 100 MG P.O. T.I.D. FAMILY HISTORY: He did not report a family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|140|141|MEDICATIONS|10. Motor vehicle crash with subsequent C-spine and L spine fusion. 11. Appendectomy. MEDICATIONS: (Unclear if this is a complete list). 1. MS Contin 30 mg b.i.d. 2. Celexa 40 mg per day. 3. Morphine immediate release 15 mg q6h p.r.n. 4. Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|105|106|RECOMMENDATIONS|Diagnosis at the time of discharge is that of management of multiple sclerosis. This 71-year-old has had MS of a progressive nature which has gotten in the way of her gait, transferring and general functioning. She was admitted to the hospital with 2/5 strength in the left leg, a fairly strong right leg and good upper extremity strength but inability to ambulate.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|152|153|ASSESSMENT, PLAN|ASSESSMENT, PLAN: 1. Narcotic toxicity. Patient gradually clearing per comparison from the ERs report as to how she was initially. Will discontinue the MS Contin, start regular scheduled Tylenol. Give the patient Vicodin p.r.n. pain as well, but will have to exercise caution regarding how much of this we use.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|209|210|DISCUSSION|Thank you for having me see this patient. My assessment was discussed with the patient's daughter who is in attendance to day. DISCUSSION: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 47-year-old white female with longstanding MS who is currently hospitalized on station 8A for evaluation of a change in mental status. I have been asked to see her by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ to assess her medical causes for mental status changes and also to assess hypertension and hyponatremia.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|119|120|HOSPITAL COURSE|On the day of her discharge, the patient was still on morphine PCA for pain control. That day, she was transitioned to MS Contin, extended release morphine tablets with p.r.n. morphine sulfate tablets. The patient was encouraged to stay in the hospital overnight to see if this pain regimen would effectively treat her pain; however, the patient was anxious to get home and request to be discharged that same day.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|119|120|MEDICATIONS|She does remain on MS Contin as well as Dilaudid p.r.n. for breakthrough pain. Neurologic is negative. MEDICATIONS: 1. MS Contin. 2. Prozac. 3. Colace. 4.

MS|multiple sclerosis|MS,|197|199|FAMILY HISTORY|SOCIAL HISTORY: He is divorced. He does not smoke. He does continue to drink about five to six beers per day. FAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed; his mother may have had some hypertension and she had severe MS, and his father apparently had schizophrenia. The patient is presently unemployed but was involved in the design of medical devices. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS : Initial blood pressure 156/100, though diastolic is now down to about 85, pulse 77 and regular, respiratory rate 20, temperature 96.5. He is 6 feet tall, 265 pounds.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|374|375|PLAN|PLAN: She is refusing any interventions that I am trying to offer her between ketoprofen gel for anti-inflammatory or any type of physical therapy, TENS unit for her back; any of those things she has decided and told me that she has tried everything and she is not able to tolerate anything other than her huge doses of morphine. She reports at home that she takes 90 mg of MS Contin t.i.d. as well as 15 mg of immediate release morphine and she is up to 6 per day on that. So her total amount that she takes according to her report is 360 mg of morphine every day.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|189|190|MEDICATIONS|5. Allegra 180 mg p.o. daily. 6. Lasix 10 mg x1 dose has been given by surgery this morning 7. She is on sliding scale insulin and TPN. 8.

LABORATORY DATA: EKG: negative T-waves in leads 3 and aVF, none significant.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|240|241|ASSESSMENT|Continue Zofran and IV fluids. 3. Chronic pain. It seems that the patient is manipulating her prescribed narcotics at home, and this may have possibly led to a withdrawal. Will consult Pain Clinic. Continue her Duragesic patch for now. Add MS overnight as needed. Plan to have them follow her pain medications in the future.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|68|69|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Past medical history is quite complicated in that the patient is on MS Contin, Lidoderm patch as an outpatient for left-sided chest pain and knee pain. She has a history of craniotomy x2 with shunt placement, secondary to cerebral aneurysms and seizures, also secondary to this.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|181|182|DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS|DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis at the time of discharge is that of management of progressive multiple sclerosis. This 73-year-old is a new patient to me and has primary progressive MS and has a 10-year history of spasms in the legs and pressure in her head and difficulty walking with weakness in her arms as well.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|231|232|LABORATORY DATA|Since his initiation on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2003, with today's treatment, _%#NAME#%_ will have received a total of 96 mg of mitoxantrone. Overall, he has tolerated the treatment quite well. He feels that since starting therapy, his MS has been stable. He does have occasional setbacks when he develops urinary tract infections, but he knows to contact you and get started on antibiotics quickly.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|108|109|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|He has only been taking a stool softener daily at this time. The patient is reasonably comfortable with his MS Contin 15 mg b.i.d. He does have some supplemental oxycodone to use q. 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. According to his wife, who is a reliable informant, he has not needed these on a significant basis.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS,|121|123|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Recurrent small bowel obstruction with an exacerbation today. Will make him NPO, give him IV fluids, MS, and Zofran as needed. I do not think he needs an NG if he is not vomiting. Follow labs. 2. Hypertension. He may take his Cozaar with sips of water.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|200|201|DISCUSSION|As above, further GI evaluation will be indicated if she has persistent diarrhea. Thank you for having me see this patient. DISCUSSION: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 41-year-old female with a history of MS whom I have been asked to see on the acute rehabilitation unit by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. Ms. _%#NAME#%_ underwent gastric bypass surgery one week ago and has been transferred from the medical/surgical unit to the acute rehabilitation setting for the treatment of exacerbation of her MS in this setting.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS.|173|175|IMPRESSION|IMPRESSION: This is a lady with MS who presents with recent urinary tract infection, increased confusion and inability to care for herself. She probably has dementia due to MS. As well, she may have metabolic encephalopathy due to multiple medications that she is on. My plan is to admit her for physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy evaluation and will plan to do EEG to rule out encephalopathy.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|206|207|DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP|DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in 10 days, on _%#MMDD2002#%_ at 3 p.m. The patient will be evaluated for pain control, with consideration toward decreasing needs in her MS Contin as the radiotherapy takes effect.

MS exacerbation with consideration of Novantrone therapy. 2. Diabetes mellitus type 2 with mild hyperglycemia at this time. 3. Hypertension under satisfactory control. 4. History of nocturnal snoring without daytime sleepiness makes her low risk for obstructive sleep apnea but this would be a consideration.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|123|124|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|Complete metabolic panel is within normal limits. UA shows a trace of leukocyte esterase. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Cerebral MS per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Hypertension (may be due to anxiety). We will monitor. Recommend low-salt diet, which is already in place per Dr. _%#NAME#%_.

OR|operating room|OR.|232|234|PLAN|I had the surgery service evaluate her, and they felt that at this point in time the best course of action would be to keep watching for underlying bleeding, along with pain, and if she manifests either, to possibly take her to the OR. Certainly, at this point in time, she appears to be resting comfortably, and actually her abdomen is fairly benign. I will go ahead and treat her diverticulitis with Zosyn, especially in light of her elevated white blood cell count, and continue to monitor her clinically.

As you know, _%#NAME#%_ is a 34-year-old, gravida 1, para 0-0-0-0 who on a routine ultrasound performed at your center revealed congenital heart defect, left pleural effusion, and a choroid plexus cyst. A follow-up Level II ultrasound was performed at the Perinatal Center, as well as an amniocentesis. Preliminary results from FISH analysis from Fairview- University Medical Center Cytogenetics Laboratory indicated that this baby has three copies of chromosome #18, which is consistent with trisomy 18.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|154|155|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|CHIEF COMPLAINT: Hypothermia and lethargy. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 43-year-old female with past medical history significant for very severe MS who was brought into the emergency department by her caregiver because of some hypothermia, as well as a change in mental status. Since she woke up she has been lethargic and has had very poor motor skills and has been dropping things.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: GENERAL: She is hungry. EYES: She has dry eyes.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|201|204|PLAN|Unfortunately, we met to review the implications of the abnormal FISH results consistent with a diagnosis of fetal trisomy 21. We began by reviewing the results. We discussed the preliminary nature of FISH results. I explained that in the context of ultrasound findings (pyelectasis) and serum biochemistry that are suggestive of Down syndrome, these results almost certainly confirm a diagnosis of fetal Down syndrome.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|103|104|DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS|He will have sitting PA and lateral x- rays of the full spine at that visit. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. MS Contin 15 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 10 days. 2. Vicodin 1 tablet p.o. t.i.d. to q.i.d. p.r.n. after discontinuation of the MS Contin.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|234|235|HOSPITAL SUMMARY|When he presented to the hospital, he underwent MR imaging which revealed evidence of an acute infarct in the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution. There were chronic appearing infarctions in both cerebellum areas. MR angiography revealed a small right vertebral artery with an apparent stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery. It was felt this was most consistent with atherosclerosis. Also noted was about 50%-60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery and a possible ulceration of the plaque was seen in the proximal left internal carotid artery.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM,|207|210|G 2   P 0010				LMP|Based on this new due date her quad screen was recalculated by your clinic and again came back at increased risk for neural tube defects. Specifically, the patient had an elevated maternal serum AFP of 2.64 MOM, which increased her risk to 1:190 for neural tube defects. The patient was referred for genetic counseling to discuss the following abnormal maternal serum AFP results as well as in conjunction with her normal level 2 ultrasound.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM|160|162|G 1   P 0000				LMP|She had stated that she thought she was not able to get pregnant, thus this pregnancy was an unexpected surprise. Her quad screen results were as follows: 1.54 MOM AFP, 0.52 MOM Estriol, 120.39 MOM HCG, and 10.29 MOM inhibin. Thus, this increased her chance for Down syndrome from her age-related risk of 1:35 to 3/4 or 75%.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|167|168|ASSESSMENT|I doubt pheochromocytoma or carcinoid tumor or coarctation of the aorta based on exam and history. There is no renal artery bruits heard. I would, however, suggest an MR angiogram of the renal arteries. I would then treated with vasodilator, diuretics and beta-blockers as well as diuretics. This can be manipulated overtime. I would avoid over-the-counter supplements.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|253|254||She had been hospitalized in _%#MM#%_ of 2004 for a similar concern, but the past few days prior to admission have gotten progressively worse. Workup was done, which showed that she had a right carotid bruit. She had those investigated. She then had an MR angiogram, which showed over 90% diameter stenosis of both right and left internal and external carotid arteries. Irregular tight stenosis of the distal left common carotid artery as well.
OR|operating room|OR|290|291|HOSPITAL COURSE|His electrolytes remained stable. Repeat CBC was stable. Because of difficulty swallowing, he underwent an esophagram, which showed the previous banding procedure but no other abnormalities. The patient was seen in consultation by Oral Surgery on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, and he was taken to the OR for extraction of teeth #s 7, 8 and 9 for fractured teeth and an alveolar fracture. Follow-up was recommended in 10-14 days and Peridex. The patient also had an echo because of his atrial fibrillation, which the preliminary report on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ showed left ventricular function within normal limits with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|138|139|HOSPITAL COURSE|The patient is willing and receptive to psychiatric care and does agree that this may be a large based component to his chronic pain. His MS Contin was increased to 30 mg p.o. q.12h. per the pain consultant and the patient will be using Tylenol on a p.r.n. basis for pain control.
IT|iliotibial|IT|153|154|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|Remainder of BMP was within normal limits. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation. No acute findings. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1.

MOM|multiples of median|MOM,|242|245|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|We discussed that increased nuchal fold as well as EIFs are associated with risks for chromosome abnormalities, specifically trisomy 21 or Down syndrome. The patient had a quad screen drawn through your clinic that resulted in an AFP of 1.05 MOM, an HCG of 0.79 MOM, an estril of 0.61 MOM, and an inhibin of 0.63 MOM. This result, which was normal, decreased the patient's age-related risk to have a baby with Down syndrome to 1:3600.

There is no evidence of a 1517 translocation by FISH study. She was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and after review of the options, including supportive care versus attempt at induction as using Gemtuzumab, it was elected to admit her on _%#MMDD2003#%_ to initiate Gemtuzumab.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|252|255|IMPRESSION/RECOMMENDATIONS|Ultrasound also was suspicious in that region. She then underwent an ultrasound biopsy on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which revealed a grade I infiltrating lobular carcinoma. This was ER positive and weekly progesterone receptor positive, was negative for HER2 by FISH analysis. The patient had some laboratory studies on _%#MMDD2007#%_ with a CBC, which was unremarkable; however, her CA 2729 tumor marker came back markedly elevated at 654.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|279|280|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|At this point, I would like to recheck a right upper quadrant ultrasound to be sure she has not developed any obvious gallbladder wall thickening or common duct dilatation. If that is negative and liver function tests reveal any abnormality, then consideration might be given to MR cholangiogram, but hopefully during the work-up the patient's pain will get back to her baseline. I think we will have significantly more options if she can get at least to her second trimester.

MS|morphine sulfate|MS|247|248|PLAN|A semi-conservative course is going to be undertaken until we can get formal Transitions And Life Choices (TLC) involvement in this case. I am going to give her some fluid aggressively and transfuse her with 2 units of packed cells. We will start MS Contin for pain control and continue her routine medicines as tolerated. I am hopeful with some normal saline and a repeat of her blood work overnight that her sodium will correct and her hemoglobin will come upwards to the point where she starts to feel better.

MR|magnetic resonance|MR|328|329|RECOMMENDATIONS|I suspect we are dealing with more problems over her baseline and I would be suspicious that her dehydration, urinary tract infection and cellulitis are the source of her recent decline, having an antecedent frail central nervous system. RECOMMENDATIONS: At this point in time I do not believe that MRI scanning of the brain or MR angiography is going to make much difference and would cancel that. I believe that antiplatelet therapy remains appropriate for her in any circumstance.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|269|270|IMPRESSION|In addition, I would further evaluate Ms. _%#NAME#%_ for any surgically accessible causes of impaired cerebrovascular blood flow. This can easily be done with carotid ultrasounds. Should the carotid ultrasounds reveal very significant stenosis, I would proceed with an MR angiogram to be sure that there was not any more distal significant stenosis which would obviate the need for surgery in her neck.

MR|magnetic resonance|MR|206|207|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right carotid endarterectomy. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 63-year-old female who was referred to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ after she had a carotid stenosis noted on MR angiography during evaluation for a neurologic workup. She had apparently had symptoms suggestive of a TIA in _%#MM2006#%_. She had not had any recurrences of that TIA, which was evaluated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_, but in discussion with her it was felt that she had significant enough risk of stroke that she did warrant carotid endarterectomy.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM|150|152|G 2   P	1001				LMP|At the time, your patient was 20 weeks gestation. The screen was within normal limits. o AFP=1.05 MOM o Estriol= 0.66 MOM o HCG= 1.47 MOM o DIA= 2.16 MOM * Adjusted risk for Down syndrome=1:170 * Adjusted risk for Trisomy 18=<1:10,000 * Adjusted risk for ONTD=1:5200 Please note that while the screen increased the Down syndrome approximately 2-3 fold above _%#NAME#%_'s age related risk (which is 1:470), this new risk still did not exceed the screening threshold of 1:150.
MOM|multiples of median|M.O.M.|310|315|G 3   P	0020				LMP|We then went on to review the results of the quad screen that _%#NAME#%_ had on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, at 15.9 weeks gestation. Specifically, the chemical values were as follows: an AFP value of 1.14 M.O.M., an hCG value of 2.16 M.O.M., an estriol value of 1.05 M.O.M., and a dimeric inhibin A value of 0.89 M.O.M. These results reduced her aged-related risk of Down syndrome of 1:259 to a newly adjusted risk of 1:2714. The screen also indicated that the risk of an open neural tube defect in this pregnancy is less than 1:5000 and the risk of trisomy 18 is less than 1:5000.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|244|247|RE|_%#NAME#%_ and her husband indicated that they were interested in pursuing a FISH analysis to provide them with some preliminary information in a timely manner, in addition to the full chromosome analysis (karyotype). As you know, _%#NAME#%_'s FISH analysis from her amniocentesis was consistent with trisomy 21. I called _%#NAME#%_ with these test results. These preliminary FISH findings were later confirmed on the final chromosome analysis, which showed a male complement of chromosomes with an extra chromosome 21 resulting from nondisjunction (47,XY, 21--see report previously faxed to your office).
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|240|243|RECOMMENDATIONS|As you know, she was initially referred for a possible cystic hygroma that was seen on their developing baby on an ultrasound performed at your clinic. She had a CVS performed on Wednesday, _%#MMDD2007#%_, by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and preliminary FISH results did confirm that this developing baby has a Turner's syndrome.

His father died of unknown causes.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|333|334|CONCLUSION|This patient also has severe carotid disease, although, he apparently has been argumentative with me about that whether the severe carotid disease is exacerbating his d ecreased cerebral perfusion from his orthostasis is probable. I am going to have him talk to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ about that to determine if further such studies such as MR angiogram or vascular surgery consult might be appropriate. I will keep all of his other medications just as they are. While it is possible he may have a different component of orthostasis from a primary neurologic problem, there is no clear history of Parkinson's disease or other movement disorder that might be associated with Shy-Drager.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|204|207|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|As you know, this young woman was diagnosed with a grade 3 invasive ductile carcinoma with high grade DCIS back in _%#MM#%_. The tumor, at that time, was also ER/PR positive, and HER2 2+ positive, and on FISH testing, it was positive. We have elected to treat her in a neo-adjuvant fashion, using a dose-dense regimen of adriamycin and taxotere every two weeks, and she has received a total of five doses, including today.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|308|311|RE|We reviewed that the FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) test is a preliminary test that gives us some initial information about whether or not there is an extra chromosome 21 (or an extra chromosome 13, chromosome 18, chromosome X or chromosome Y, as these are other chromosomes that are included in a FISH anaysis). We talked about that FISH results are typically available within 24-48 hours, but that the final chromosome analysis which examines all the chromosomes in more detail take approximately 10 to 14 days to get back.

MS|morphine sulfate|MS|259|260|DISCHARGE PLANNING|DISCHARGE PLANNING: The patient was discharged to Ebenezer Luther Hall, where she probably will be switched ultimately to a palliative bed, although initially there were none of those available. Hospice care will be following her. They recommended her taking MS Contin 15 mg b.i.d., Robitussin AC as needed if she had a cough, also Benadryl as needed, Lotrimin cream for the pubic area, where she was experiencing significant itching, and they will continue to follow for palliative cares as needed.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|230|231|ASSESSMENT|If Ritalin ineffective in the next three to five days would increase the dose to 10 mg in the morning and at noon. 3. Headache and ongoing dyspnea. Would strongly consider low dose long acting opioid to help manage both symptoms. MS Contin 15 mg p.o. b.i.d. would be the most appropriate dose at this time. 4. Care planning. The patient wishes to do everything possible to prolong his life, but if he does die or code he does not wish attempts at resuscitation and does not wish to be intubated and that was again discussed with him today and remains his plan.

MR|magnetic resonance|MR|307|308|PLAN|ASSESSMENT: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, multiple stools. Must rule out graft occlusion or stenosis related to his pervious procedure, but this may be something relatively simple, such as gastroenteritis or cholecystitis. PLAN: We will check a serum lactate level and repeat his labs. We will check an MR angiogram. Discussed in detail with the patient. Discussed with Dr. _%#NAME#%_, who will follow up with him in the morning.

MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|111|112|IMPRESSION|Similarly, one would have expected to hear the murmur on previous exams, and doubt it is new to have this much MR and TR; to be acute would be unusual. One wonders about chronic atrial fibrillation leading to atrial enlargement, annular dilatation and progressive MR and TR in the setting of what was no doubt lung disease and cor pulmonale in a patient with previous sarcoid and who is a heavy smoker; that would also account for why the right bundle branch block pattern is seen.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|199|202|DISCHARGE DISPOSITION|However, he would be happy to see _%#NAME#%_ in follow-up as an outpatient. Problem #3: Genetics. _%#NAME#%_ has a normal XY karyotype with no numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities seen. FISH probes for 22q11.2 and 22q13.3 showed no deletion or duplication. Dr. _%#NAME#%_, our cranial-facial dental specialist, also examined _%#NAME#%_ and felt his features did not represent any specific syndrome.

Her quad screen results were as follows: 0.74 MOM AFP, 1.15 MOM HCG, 1.22 MOM Estriol, and 2.42 MOM inhibin. This, this increases her chances to have a baby with Down's syndrome with her age-related risk of 1 in 310 to 1 in 80.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|139|140|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|5) Functional abilities are very limited due to the patient's severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Would look to establish a base MS Contin dose so that the patient might be more comfortable and perhaps more functional. Hope the patient would be able to eat better if dyspnea is controlled.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|344|345|HOSPITAL COURSE|It turns out the patient later revealed that he had been adjusting his furosemide doses on his own as an outpatient, and therefore, his listed doses varied somewhat from what he was actually taking at home. This should be readdressed in future visits. 4. HISTORY OF ALLERGIES: THE PATIENT LISTS MULTIPLE DRUGS TO WHICH HE IS ALLERGIC, HOWEVER, IT TURNS OUT THAT MOST OF THESE ARE NOT ALLERGIES IN THE TRUE SENSE. THE PATIENT REPORTS NOSEBLEED WITH DURICEF, NOSEBLEED WITH SULA DRUGS, ITCHING AND POSSIBLE REDMAN SYNDROME WITH VANCOMYCIN, AND A TRANSIENT RASH WHILE ON AUGMENTIN, ALTHOUGH, THE PATIENT WAS ON AUGMENTIN FOR A TOTAL OF 2 MONTHS AND THE RASH RESOLVED DURING THIS TIME.
OR|operating room|OR.|146|148|HOSPITAL COURSE|The Port-A-Cath was removed under fluoroscopy and PICC line was used for access. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed by Pulmonary Medicine in the OR. A large, right mainstem sputum plug was removed and the bronchi were healthy. Fungal cultures from postoperative sputa and bronchoscopy specimens grew Aspergillus Fumigatus.
IT|information technology|IT|281|282|HOSPITAL COURSE|They felt that since the patient overall felt much better by the time the surgeon got it and felt like everything was improving, would hold off on the OR but any symptoms at all that slightly worsened would cause him to have surgery for further treatment of the diverticulitis. An IT consult was obtained just to maximize the medication given the small perforation. He continued to improve, his vitals remained stable. He was disappointed after a couple days that he could not eat as he felt definitely hungry and felt everything was back to normal, the pain was gone.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|131|132|RE|He has responded well to steroids whenever we have needed them, although this is not one of those situations. He is on no specific MS related drug at this time. He is on Trileptal, which he takes for seizures, and that tends to exacerbate the hyponatremia to some degree.
US|United States|US|237|238|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension and nephrolithiasis, who comes to the Ridges ER complaining of left flank pain.

MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|245|246|ASSESSMENT|Long term adhesive capsulitis is difficult to manage and often times requires surgical manipulation under anesthesia. A year out from the time the problem begins adhesive capsulitis is certainly a problem seen in quadriplegics and especially in MS patients or patient who have decreased active movements because of neurologic or muscular weakness. If the patient develops pain that is intractable and would like to try a steroid injection this can certainly be arranged on an outpatient basis when he is in clinic for his hematology oncology follow up and neurologic appointment.
US|United States|US|138|139|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY|Her energy level is significantly lower and she has been sleeping more than usual. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient was born here in the US via term vaginal delivery. Mother had a GBS infection and there is some question of the infant having some sepsis at birth.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|260|261|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|2. MS. TREATMENTS: Debridement of right ischial decubitus with re-advancement of posterior thigh flap and VAC placement to donor posterior right thigh. This was done on _%#MMDD2007#%_. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is as 63-year-old gentleman with advanced MS who originally presented with a persistent right ischial decubitus. This had been previously debrided and closed with a small local flap, which recurred.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|225|226|LOCATION|We started treatment on _%#MMDD2006#%_ and concluded today. She received 24 mg each 12 weeks and, with today's treatment, she will have total of 96 mg. Thus far, the patient indicates that she has noted no improvement in her MS and actually thinks she may be getting worse. There is a significant amount of psychosocial things going on in her life, and she mentioned how depressed and worthless she is feeling.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|225|226|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|Toes were equivocal. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were intact. Her gait was slightly stiff. She had trouble tandem walking. In summary, we have a woman with a history of a neurologic syndrome that could be either lupus or MS and this needs to be clarified as the findings would be identical on clinical examination, MRI and even the spinal tap.
OR|operating room|OR.|212|214|PROBLEM #7|She was started on Macrobid 100 mg q.d. for prophylaxis and she will be d/c to the Rehabilitation Center with this Foley in place. PROBLEM #7: Infectious Disease. She received one gram of Ancef IV on call to the OR. The patient was afebrile throughout her hospitalization. She was started on Macrobid 100 mg p.o. q.d. prophylaxis for an indwelling Foley catheter.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|223|224|REASON FOR CONSULTATION|Recently she has had increasing difficulty with lower extremity pain and pain and discomfort in the low back region. The patient was hospitalized and has subsequently developed bladder incontinence. Evaluation has included MR scan of the spine which shows no evidence of epidural or leptomeningeal involvement. The patient has also undergone a spinal fluid tap carried out late last week.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|193|194|ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS|The patient was started on heparin. The decision was made to defer lysis of the thrombosis because of the mild symptoms, partial nature of the thrombosis, and relatively good appearance of the MR scan. A urine pregnancy test was confirmed as negative. The oral contraceptive agents were stopped. The patient was started on Coumadin. A Hematology consultation was obtained which agreed with the anticoagulation and recommended Coumadin for 6 months.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|161|162||The patient was scheduled to start mitoxantrone on _%#MMDD2003#%_, but he decided to delay it for a while and try alternative medicine. Since that decision, his MS has had a couple of flares, with an episode of left lower leg numbness, and the patient is now ready to take the proposed mitoxantrone treatment.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|206|207|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY|She took this but did stop it about two weeks ago and since that time has had trouble maintaining her INR in the 2-3 range. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CVI in _%#MM#%_ 2006. The patient had a workup including MR angiography which suggested of a developmentally small right vertebral artery without any dissection and a possible occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery at the P1 level as well as findings consistent with acute infarct in the right posterior cerebral artery distribution.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|197|198|MAJOR  PROCEDURES AND TREATMENTS|1. Simultaneous living donor kidney (brother) and deceased donor pancreas transplant with bladder drainage on _%#MMDD2007#%_. 2. Packed red blood cell transfusion. 3. Ultrasound of the abdomen. 4. MR angiogram of abdomen. 5. Total parenteral nutrition.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|365|368|PROCEDURES PERFORMED|It was felt that this was not associated with malrotation and for this reason we increased her lactulose and increased her regimen to maintain a higher stool output and decrease her symptomatic constipation, which she presented with. We did obtain a genetics and metabolism consult with Dr. _%#NAME#%_, who recommended that resend high-resolution chromosomes and a FISH for velocardiofacial syndrome. These labs remained pending at the time of this dictation. Furthermore, we did an MRI of the cranium and brain, which was found to be unremarkable with the skull findings to be not consistent with velocardiofacial syndrome despite her constellation of ASD versus PFO, developmental delay, and dysplastic right kidney.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|168|169|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|The study shows areas of restricted diffusion in the watershed zone between the superficial distributions of the left middle anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries.

She underwent induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine (7+3 regimen).
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|187|188|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|In addition to his tremor, Mr. _%#NAME#%_ has striking generalized weakness which strikes me as being much more pronounced than would be anticipated on the basis of deconditioning alone. IT is conceivable that the recent addition of prednisone in the context of an Intensive Care Unit stay and relative immobility has caused a mild critical care myopathy or steroid myopathy.

MOM|multiples of median|MOM|152|154|G 5   P	3013				LMP|This delivery date was consistent with a 9-week ultrasound. Her quad screen results were as follows: 1.21 MOM AFP, 4.55 MOM HCG, 0.63 MOM Estriol, 3.84 MOM inhibit. Thus, this increased her risks for Down syndrome from her age-related risks of 1 in 920 to 1 in 90. We reviewed possible explanations for this abnormal quad screen including normal variation, baby with Down syndrome, increased risk for pregnancy complications such as low birth weight, maternal hypertension, or per-term labor.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|220|221|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|For this reason, a neurology consultation was obtained. He did have a couple falls during his hospitalization and a CT scan of the brain without contrast was unremarkable and yesterday he had an MRI of the brain with an MR angiogram of the brain which were also unremarkable. In the meanwhile, he has been found to have dysphagia and therefore he is being fed with a feeding tube.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|272|275|RECOMMENDATIONS|At the conclusion of our discussion, the patient elected to proceed with a Level II ultrasound and was unsure as to whether she would consider an amniocentesis. After her ultrasound, Ms. _%#NAME#%_ decided to have the amniocentesis. Preliminary results from this testing, FISH analysis, will be available within 24 to 48 hours.

However, secondary to being unable to tolerate the GoLYTELY as well as magnesium citrate, the patient's surgery has been canceled.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|274|277|RECOMMENDATIONS|The availability of FISH studies, fluorescence in situ hybridization studies, to look specifically for numerical abnormalities in chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y were discussed. The turn around time for FISH studies is approximately 24 to 48 hours. The preliminary nature of FISH results were described to the patient. Given the ultrasound findings we briefly discussed the availability of options for the pregnancy following the amniocentesis results, continuation of the pregnancy, or termination were briefly discussed with the patient.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|228|231|HOSPITAL COURSE|A standard EEG on _%#MMDD2006#%_ was normal. _%#NAME#%_ received pediatric neurology evaluation in the past from Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ as well.

At the present time, his blood has been submitted for comparative genomic hybridization study, with results currently pending.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|237|240|RECOMMENDATIONS|Helen also has speech issues and is getting some speech therapy. Helen did have chromosomes performed at the Cytogenetics Laboratory at University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, which revealed a 46, XX normal karyotpe and normal FISH studies for 22q deletion. We discussed that congenital heart defects are multifactorial in inheritance and that this pregnancy would be at increased risk for a congenital heart defect, thus we would recommend a fetal echocardiogram at 20-22 weeks' gestation.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|250|251|OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED|Otherwise negative. ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: NKDA. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother passed away at age 64 of thrombophlebitis. The patient's father passed away at age 56 with an myocardial infarction. The patient has 1 sister with MS and 1 sister has emphysema. The patient also has a brother who is alive and well. A maternal grandmother had breast disease. No history of colon, uterine, or ovarian cancer.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM.|203|206|G 4   P	1021				LMP|In addition, the patient had a quad screen drawn through your clinic on _%#MMDD2006#%_, at 16 weeks gestation which resulted in an AFP of 2.61 MOM and HCG 0.8 MOM, and SGO of 0.8 MOM and inhibin of 1.40 MOM. This decreased her risk to have a baby with Down's syndrome to 1:1200 and her trisomy 18 risk was estimated at 1:10,000.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|208|209|RECOMMENDATIONS|If such episodes continue to occur and there is no particular cause for forthcoming then I would recommend obtaining imaging of the cervical spine as well. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. For now, I will proceed with an MR angiogram of the Circle of Willis and the great vessels of the neck. 2. I would also recommend obtaining a transesophageal echocardiogram looking for a patent foramen ovale.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|172|173|SUMMARY|I would recommend checking the cholesterol, as well as hemoglobin A1c. Carotid ultrasound is a reasonable improvement test, but I would actually be interested in seeing an MR of the brain and brain stem to insure that the localization is consistent with small vessel involvement. If that is the case, aspirin (or Plavix) should be sufficient therapy.
OR|operating room|OR|235|236|HOSPITAL COURSE|HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Right neck abscess. The patient was admitted and initially started empirically on Levaquin and clindamycin and ENT consult was obtained and felt that the right neck abscess needed to be drained.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|216|219|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|This treatment was interrupted because of the development of VRE sepsis, which required a 2-day ICU stay. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy on _%#MMDD2006#%_ (UHH06-1914) revealed no morphologic evidence of leukemia. A FISH study revealed no evidence of residual leukemia. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is in need of a bone marrow transplant. He has no matched sibling or unrelated donors.
US|ultrasound|US|234|235|1. FEN|He was supported with TPN during this time. Since _%#MMDD2004#%_ he tolerated BF+ENFAMIL20 with iron very well. 2. Renal-The initial creatinine-1.9, BUN-21 on admission, this improved significantly after 2 days, _%#MMDD2004#%_-.Renal US was done which showed no abnormalities. The Bun and Cr had normalized by the time of discharge. Bun 5. Cr 0.83. It was unclear the etiology of the initial elevations, but they may have been due to decreased renal blood flow associated with the mild polycythemia.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|181|182|ASSESSMENT|He has had a CT scan which was negative for vascular disease, but he has had a partial MRI scan which shows some white matter changes that are consistent with but not diagnostic of MS or vascular disease. That MRI is not good enough to make any diagnosis with. I believe that he needs to have a workup for multifocal central nervous system disease with appropriate blood work looking for demyelination with appropriate blood work, looking for other causes that may mimic demyelination such as CADASIL, sarcoid Sjogren's, etc.

MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|191|193|HISTORY  OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Eventually her atrial fibrillation was controlled well and her diarrhea ceased. An echo at that time was performed which revealed any ejection fraction of 65% with mild aortic stenosis, mild MR, mild atrial enlargement, and a right ventricular systolic pressure that was mild to moderately increased. She was started on Coumadin at that time and received Lovenox to ramp her Coumadin level up to a therapeutic range.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|244|247|IMPRESSION|_%#NAME#%_ obviously was quite concerned regarding her abnormal quad screen results and a Level II ultrasound, which was performed today, did not show any apparent abnormalities.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|326|329|RECOMMENDATIONS|Since that time, he has been on chemotherapy with alpha interferon and cytosine arabinoside, and I am pleased to report that he remains in a very solid complete remission, both from molecular testing as well as chromosome studies. His last bone marrow on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2003, was normocellular, with normal hematopoiesis. FISH testing for the BCR/ADL gene rearrangement were negative, and cytogenetics also were negative for the Philadelphia chromosome. His only evidence of hematological problems is a decreased white count, but I attribute this to his ara-C and interferon treatments, and he has not had problems with infections.

She IS ON A DNR, DNI STATUS, BUT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED BEFORE BY THE PATIENT AND HER FAMILY THAT IF NEEDED, A SHORT TIME INTUBATION, For ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS IS DESIRED.
OR|operating room|OR|191|192|HOSPITAL COURSE|The patient was taken back to OR where a hematoma was evacuated by our Vascular Surgery colleagues. They did not see any damage to the vessel nor did they see any current bleeding upon their OR exploration. The patient was discharged with a healing, not enlarging, hematoma in her left groin extending more distally. Of note the patient did develop this hematoma while being anticoagulated with heparin and Coumadin for her pulmonary embolism.
US|United States|US|106|107|SOCIAL  HISTORY|FAMILY HISTORY: Really unclear. No real contributing factors. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has been in the US for 10 years. He is living with his wife. They both speak very little English and translator was present today to help out.

SOCIAL HISTORY: He is employed by the Target Corporation where he works in the IT department. He does not use tobacco, alcohol or drugs. FAMILY HISTORY: Apparently, there is Alzheimer's disease in his family, rheumatoid arthritis, CVAs, and he thinks his mother has coronary artery disease.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|217|218|RECOMMENDATIONS|I very much doubt that the PFO has anything to do with this but I was unable to obtain the formal report to look at the specifics regarding this PFO. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. MRI of the brain with and without contrast. 2. MR angiogram of the neck and circle of Willis. 3. Echocardiogram. 4. EEG. 5. Target INR should be 2.5. Until the patient's INR is above 2 she should remain on heparin.
OR|operating room|OR|220|221|PROCEDURES PERFORMED DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION|After extensive workup and evaluation, it was deemed the patient was appropriate for surgical intervention for her obesity. So, on _%#DDMM2006#%_, after obtaining written and verbal consent, the patient was taken to the OR (see specific operative note for details). Following the patient's postoperative course, the patient was admitted to 7-beta.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|287|288|HISTORY|He presented to the Fairview-Southdale Hospital Emergency Department. At the time monitors were attached, he was noted to have some PAC's, but they could not document anything further. He does have a history of atrial fibrillation. Initial cardiac enzymes and EKG were normal or stable. IT was elected to admit him overnight for cardiac monitoring. He has remained in a sinus rhythm overnight. Subsequent cardiac enzymes have been negative or normal.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|219|220|PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT|The board and care facility there will take her on hospice and also too Fairview Hospice will follow her and work with the care team there. PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT: The pain and symptoms are being well managed. The MS Contin, since the patient is unable to swallow, will be given rectally and also too there will be morphine, Roxanol backup for breakthrough pain and also too for dyspnea.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|232|233|DRUG SENSITIVITIES|3. Paxil at bedtime. 4. He is diagnosed with Autism and pervasive developmental delay. FAMILY HISTORY: Known at this time. DRUG SENSITIVITIES: HE IS ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS WHICH GIVE HIM HIVES, BENADRYL IS NOT AN ALLERGIC REACTION BUT IT MAKES HIM HYPERACTIVE. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Essentially normal except for history of allergy and hayfever and use of albuterol inhaler prn for hayfever.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|170|171|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|His symptoms have now become somewhat more progressive occurring at rest, associated with atypical back pain. At the present time I do think it is appropriate to perform MR of his chest as a potential dissection, although low on the list of concern, is of grave consequence if positive. With his mild anemia and slightly positive stool hemoccults, I am going to hold anticoagulation at this point and continue with an aspirin.
US|United States|US|39|40|SOCIAL HISTORY|SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a veteran of the US Air Force, retired in 1972 and was a professional truck driver. No smoking since 1976. Social alcohol consumption once or twice a weekend.

MOM|multiples of median|MOM|154|156|LABORATORY ON ADMISSION|She reported having one dental x-ray during her pregnancy. Her quad screen levels were as follows: 1.41 MOM AFP, 0.67 MOM estriol, 1.77 MOM HCG, and 3.27 MOM inhibin. This quad screen increased her risk to have a baby with Down syndrome from her age-related risk of 1 in 491 to 1 in 217.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM.|492|495|G 1   P 0000				LMP|o AFP=0.97 MOM o Estriol= 0.42 MOM o HCG= 5.06 MOM o DIA= 1.42 MOM * Adjusted risk for Down syndrome=1:90 Screen positive * Adjusted risk for Trisomy 18=1:2600 * Adjusted risk for ONTD=1:6200 * We discussed possible explanations for an abnormal serum screen including inconsistencies in pregnancy dating, normal variations in the levels of these chemicals, and the possibility of Down syndrome in the current pregnancy. * We discussed the fact that the HCG was significantly elevated at 5.06 MOM. I explained that there previously was discussion about whether elevated HCG is associated with an increased risk for abnormal pregnancy outcomes.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|166|167|HOSPITAL COURSE|The elevation in troponin was thought secondary to the pneumonia process. Also, a 2D echocardiogram was obtained which showed a normal ejection fraction of 60%, mild MR and mild TR. On the second day of hospitalization, he started having melenic stool. His hemoglobin dropped to 6 from 11. A GI consultation was obtained and patient underwent an upper GI endoscopy in the Intensive Care Unit.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|186|189|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|A needle biopsy was performed on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade III. The tumor was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative and by FISH analysis it was positive. The patient was seen by a Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and given her poor pulmonary status, she was not felt to be an optimal candidate for general anesthesia.
OR|operating room|OR|200|201|HOSPITAL COURSE|She was treated conservatively and went to a nursing home for an anticipated short term stay on _%#MMDD#%_. She presented early this morning with severe left lower quadrant pain. She was taken to the OR by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at which time a laparotomy showed multiple abnormalities prompting a sigmoid resection and a resection of a small segment of small bowel.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|183|184|SUGGESTIONS|2. If the patient is not alert, at least back to her baseline by tomorrow a.m., I think we should repeat an MRI of the brain with contrast to evaluate further and compare to previous MR studies and rule out carcinomatous meningitis. Radiation necrosis could explain a deteriorating neurologic status as well, however. I spoke with the patient's husband at length. Neurology will follow with you for now.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|124|125|DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS|2. Diovan 40 mg daily. 3. Gabapentin 600 mg q.i.d. 4. Furosemide 20 mg daily. 5. Senokot 2 tablets each day at bed-time. 6.

OR|operating room|OR|175|176|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|Preoperative hemoglobin was 14.4. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Left comminuted distal humerus fracture. The patient is postop day 0. She has possible failure of her fixator and repeat OR eval is pending today. She is currently seen in postop and is stable with no evidence of any cardiac ischemia or fluid overload.
OR|operating room|OR;|387|389|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|When I went to see the patient in greater detail later in the morning, the patient was severely obtunded and had signs of an acute abdomen; indeed, his lactic acid came back at 16 and the surgeons were deciding to take the patient to he operating room. We discussed the situation and our views with the surgery resident in the ICU; we agreed with the decision to take the patient to the OR; we said we would be happy to continue to be involved in the patient's care if seemed likely to be helpful, but that we thought the problem was not primarily a hematologic one.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|458|459|COURSE OF STAY IN THE HOSPITAL|On the time of stay, a CT scan of the head was done, and it was not suggestive of a hemorrhagic stroke. An MRA and MRI were done. The impression on the MRA is moderate-sized area of recent infarction in inferior-posterior left occipital lobe and a small second area of recent infarct in the anteromedial portion of the left occipital lobe; high-grade short-segment stenosis, left posterior cerebral artery P1 segment; and the last one is marginal quality of MR angiogram of the neck vessels due to the patient motion but no evidence for high-grade stenosis of either carotid bifurcation.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|216|217|HOSPITAL COURSE|They made recommendations about dressing changes. CT scan was performed which demonstrated the tube to be in adequate position and not a possible precipitating factor for acute renal failure or abdominal distention. IT should be noted that he had initial urine culture with three different bacteria. Was treated with Levaquin and Vanco. Subsequent follow-up cultures showed just non hemolytic strep.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR.|282|284|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|She was also been seen in by the cardiologist during her hospitalization and had new cardioechogram done at the University, which showed ejection fraction of 65%, mild aortic stenosis, mild MR, moderate atrial enlargement and RV systolic pressure mild to moderately increased, mild MR. She was started on Coumadin also as well as receiving Lovenox shots daily to keep her INR at the range of 2-3. At the day of discharge, she had not had any arrhythmia and denies having any chest pain.

He lives in _%#CITY#%_, Minnesota. He was born in the U.S. He has no recent travel. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Reviewed per the electronic record and afebrile, stable and normal for age.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|150|153|1. FEN|This also may represent transient hypoparathyroidism in the infant. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ felt that it would be prudent to check for DiGeorge syndrome and a FISH study is pending at the time of discharge. We would suggest the following cares next week since the calcium level is only 7.9 with ionized calcium 4.2 and increased phosphorus level of 9.3. Magnesium level is now normal at 1.9. Problem #2: Seizures.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|215|218|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|After our discussion, Lesley proceeded with an ultrasound and amniocentesis. Please see the perinatologist's report for more details regarding her ultrasound examination. Lesley then proceeded with amniocentesis. A FISH analysis was ordered, and results of this were normal (two chromosome 21 signals, two chromosome 13 signals and 2 chromosome 18 signals).
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|169|171|OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED|It was felt that the etiology of her shortness of breath was multifactorial, including restrictive obstructive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, moderate- to-severe MR, and moderate aortic regurgitation, and also ventricular dysynchrony. DISCHARGE PLAN: She should follow up with her primary care physician, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, in 1 to 2 weeks. She will also follow up with electrophysiology in 1 month, and she is to undergo a repeat echocardiogram at Fairview in 4 months with cardiology to evaluate left ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction, and for her mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|275|278|PROCEDURES PERFORMED|Bone marrow biopsy on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, suboptimal showing 5% cellularity with decreased granulopoiesis; and most recent bone marrow biopsy was on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, which showed essentially aplastic marrow with less than 5% cellularity and normal cytogenetics. FISH had 2/500 cells with monosomy 7. The patient was admitted for ATG treatment. He had no complaints at the time of admission.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|212|213|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|She has no obvious medical contraindications for proceeding with the surgical repair. However, the patient will need to be observed closely postoperatively and anesthesia will need to be given carefully with her MS in mind. It is possible that she may take a while longer to come out from the effects of the anesthesia given her MS.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|151|152|ALLERGIES|2) A statin. 3) Flonase. 4) Loratadine. 5) Lexapro. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES, ALTHOUGH SHE STATES SHE HAS A DRUG INTOLERANCE TO MORPHINE AND IT CAUSES HER TO VOMIT. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke, does not drink alcohol.

IT|ischial tuberosity|IT|247|248|HOSPITAL COURSE|The right ischial pressure wound had 2 openings that communicated and 1 over IT that extended towards right hip oozing a moderate to heavy serosanguineous drainage. This was clearly a stage 4 pressure wound where it extended to the bone. The left IT pressure wound was also deeply tunneling with moderate drainage. The patient was evaluated by Wound Ostomy Care, Plastic Surgery and Orthopedic Surgery to treat these wounds as well as Infectious Disease.
OR|operating room|OR|207|208|HOSPITAL COURSE|On hospital day 2, _%#NAME#%_ had a water-soluble contrast enema performed which was concerning for an internal abdominal hernia. A surgery was consulted immediately. On hospital day 3, she was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy where Dr. _%#NAME#%_ discovered that her right colon was non-fixated. He performed a cecopexy and also did an inversion appendectomy.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|164|167|RECOMMENDATIONS|As you know, she presented back in _%#MM2004#%_ with a right breast mass. It was a large 9 cm centrally located lesion. It was ER positive and PR negative, also by FISH analysis it was HER-2 negative. PET scan revealed that she had metastatic disease to bone, as well as periaortic and superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

In addition, the patient had a quad screen drawn through your clinic on _%#MMDD2006#%_, at 16 weeks gestation which resulted in an AFP of 2.61 MOM and HCG 0.8 MOM, and SGO of 0.8 MOM and inhibin of 1.40 MOM. This decreased her risk to have a baby with Down's syndrome to 1:1200 and her trisomy 18 risk was estimated at 1:10,000.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM,|287|290|IMPRESSION|It was explained that low maternal AFP and estradiol levels, together with elevated hCG levels, indicate an increased risk of Down syndrome in a pregnancy. _%#NAME#%_'s' maternal serum sample was obtained on _%#MMDD2005#%_ at 15.57 weeks' gestation, and resulted in an AFP value of 0.79 MOM, an estriol value of 0.65 MOM, and a hCG value of 1.74 MOM. This increased the patient's chance of having a child with Down syndrome from her age-related risk of 1 in 470 (0.2%) to a newly adjusted chance of 1 in 120 (0.8%). The clinical features and genetics of Down syndrome were briefly reviewed with the couple.
OR|operating room|OR|140|141|BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY|He was placed on the transplant approximately a year or so ago. Lungs became available for him on _%#DDMM2003#%_, and he was brought to the OR for lung transplant. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. Anxiety.
IT|intrathecal|IT|160|161|HOSPITAL COURSE/PLAN|If there is any change in antibiotic sensitivity, the patient will be called. 2. Chronic left shoulder pain. No current issues, so patient will continue on the IT pump and oxycodone p.r.n. 3. Posttraumatic stress disorder; no current issues. 4. Depression, stable on Prozac. DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP: 1. Follow up with primary care doctor, Dr. _%#NAME#%_, in 1 week.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|237|238|LABORATORY DATA|His brain imaging studies included the unremarkable CT scan, but the MRI of the brain showed an acute ischemic injury in the left pons. He also has more diffuse and nonspecific white matter changes, likely small vessel ischemic changes. MR angiography of the head and MR angiography of the vessels in the neck is really quite unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Left pontine infarct. We cannot determine whether this is due to small vessel disease or ischemic infarct but with the suspected left ventricular thrombus, this could also represent an embolic infarct.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|190|193|LABORATORY DATA|LABORATORY DATA: I reviewed the pathology that shows a metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a breast primary in 2 out of 18 lymph nodes. Additional immuno stains for BRST2, ER, PR, and FISH for HRT2 are still pending. IMPRESSION: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 51-year-old premenopausal woman who likely has a left breast cancer metastatic to two axillary lymph nodes.
US|United States|US|139|140|SOCIAL HISTORY|SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a house in _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ with his brother. He has no children. He is a computer specialist at US bank. He is an immigrant from Thailand 32 years ago. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Currently, is dominated by postsurgical pain, otherwise a 10 review of systems is entirely negative.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|136|137|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|7. I discussed CODE STATUS With THE PATIENT AND HER SON, MRS. _%#NAME#%_ APPARENTLY HAS ADVANCED DIRECTIVES. She WISHES TO BE DNR, DNI, IT WILL THEREFORE BE NOTED IN The CHART THAT THE PATIENT IS DNR, DNI.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR.|127|129||She has had aortic gradient recheck by ultrasound that was 12.5 mm mean gradient with thus mild AS. Also had mild AI, and mild MR. She has had a previous cardiac echocardiogram which did not show abnormalities other than LVH and RVH. In the hospital present visit she underwent carotid ultrasound which showed minimal plaque at the bifurcation of the arteries.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|203|204|HISTORY/HOSPITAL COURSE|This was done with some anxiety as she had a history of diabetes and renal insufficiency. Cardiac catheterization was performed on _%#MMDD2004#%_. Ejection fraction was approximately 45%. No significant MR was noted. During the procedure, the patient developed worsening respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and needed to be intubated. Patient received an extensive coronary intervention with a total of 550 cc of dye.
IT|iliotibial|IT|160|161|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|Lithium level less than 0.2. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Bipolar affective disorder. Treatment per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Knee pain. The patient was told that this was IT band syndrome by his doctor. The patient only has pain when he is physically active, and he has not been physically active for some time, so he has had no pain for some time.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|157|160|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|We had seen her during this previous pregnancy at the Maternal Fetal Medicine Center. _%#NAME#%_ has had normal chromosomal analysis 46 XY as well as normal FISH for 22Q deletion. Thus, it was felt that he had isolated hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We discussed recurrence risk based on empiric information for subsequent pregnancies to have any type of congenital heart defect is approximately 2%.
FISH|GENERAL ENGLISH|FISH|112|115|ALLERGIES|2. Chest tube placement x2. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Prenatal vitamins. ALLERGIES: ERYTHROMYCIN CAUSED HIVES. SHELL FISH CAUSES ERYTHEMAOF THE NECK. KIWI CAUSES THROAT SWELLING. FAMILY HISTORY: Unilateral breast cancer in her mother at age 48.
OR|operating room|OR,|236|238|HOSPITAL COURSE|X-rays revealed a dislocated hip. Talked with the family of risks, benefits and she is admitted at this time for a revision. Therefore, on _%#DDMM2007#%_, the patient after being medically stable or medically cleared was brought to the OR, where revision of her hip was performed. The patient postoperatively was on IV antibiotics until cultures came back, which did come back positive and we kept her on IV medication throughout her hospital course.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|189|190|REASON FOR CONSULTATION|At this point he does not have any symptoms of angina or of congestive heart failure. He also has had a stent placed in the left external iliac artery. He has a small left kidney. He had a MR angiogram of the abdomen done on _%#MMDD2004#%_ and this shows the superior mesenteric artery wide open. The patient has been on a proton pump inhibitor for quite awhile.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|218|219|ASSESSMENT|Wound culture shows heavy-growth Strep, many gram-positive cocci, many gram-negative rods, heavy-growth anaerobes. ASSESSMENT: Probable, at least some, contribution of ischemia. Discussed the options of Doppler study, MR angiography. If abnormal these would lead to angiography. Given his young age, low risk for angiography and high risk of limb loss I think we should proceed directly to angiography in an effort to assess for revascularization.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|296|297||He was hoping to be able to be treated as outpatient with OxyContin and breakthrough Percocet until he had his lithotripsy which is scheduled for Monday, but the pain got so severe today with increasing nausea, that he needed to come in for pain management and possible dehydration. He was given MS and Dilaudid as well as Zofran and Toradol in the emergency room. He is a lot better now. Pain is about 3 out of 10, but he knows the pain will soon come back.
US|ultrasound|US|131|132|DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS|A repeat US on _%#MMDD2006#%_ revealed no change in bilateral Grade II IVH with slight decrease in size of the ventricular system. US on _%#MMDD2006#%_ revealed normal evolution of bilateral Grade II IVH. US On _%#MMDD2006#%_ revealed further evolution, and normal periventricular white matter.
US|United States|U.S.|131|134|SOCIAL HISTORY|PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy. He has never had a blood transfusion. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is an accountant. He has worked with U.S. Bank for the past seven years. He rents a dwelling. He has been separated from his wife for the past three years.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|150|153|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Blasts were seen on the peripheral smear. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were negative. Bone marrow biopsy revealed B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. FISH analysis showed bcr/abl positive. A MUGA scan was performed and revealed an ejection fraction of 41%. CSF was negative. Mrs. _%#NAME#%_ was started on hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and Gleevec.
OR|operating room|OR|161|162|ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS|ENoG study demonstrated a 5% remaining function in the nerve. He was, therefore, a candidate for emergent decompression of the facial nerve. He was taken to the OR on the evening of _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005. The procedure was successful in that the nerve was adequately decompressed and visualized.

VITAL SIGNS: Height of 5'10", weight 203, blood pressure 116/70 and hemoglobin 12.7. HEENT: Pupils equally accommodate.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|181|182|RECOMMENDATIONS|2. I did review the MRI of the brain. There does not appear to be any acute ischemia to my eye. Will await the formal report. 3. I would cancel the carotid ultrasound and obtain an MR angiogram of the great vessels of the neck so that we can take a better look at the posterior circulation as well as an MRI of the circle of Willis.
OR|operating room|OR|271|272|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Abdominal x-ray showed that he had free air and subsequently went to the operating room where he was found to have a gangrenous small bowel and underwent small bowel resection. The patient over the next 24 hours had a persistent lactic acidosis so he brought back to the OR today and nothing was noted. There was no anastomotic leak, and there was no ischemia. The patient remains on vasopressors oxygenating well, but he is requiring 100% 02.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|279|282|IMPRESSION|The patient was informed that while the amniocentesis is able to diagnose structural chromosome abnormalities such as Down syndrome with 99.4% accuracy, it is not able to test for all causes of mental retardation and birth defects in a pregnancy. The benefits and limitations of FISH testing were also discussed with the patient, and they elected FISH analysis as well for preliminary result. Family History: _%#NAME#%_ is 37 years old, and will be 38 at delivery.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|173|174|RECOMMENDATIONS|2. Pain consultation. 3. KinAir bed and frequent positional changes to prevent skin breakdown. 4. PT and OT for passive range of motion as tolerated. 5. Given her end-stage MS disease and severe stroke end-of-life issues, TLC/hospice should be considered. Palliative care consult should be initiated after some discussion with family members.

She indicates she will be discharged tomorrow from the hospital, so we will proceed with making outpatient arrangements for admission for surgery on Tuesday, _%#MMDD#%_.
OR|operating room|OR|227|228|IMPRESSION|The atenolol dose is apparently 50 mg daily. Her heart rate is slow, most likely related to this. She had a rash over her left upper extremity which at the moment appears to be related to a local issues with trauma down in the OR and pre and postoperative area in relation to her blood pressure cuff and needle stick in the left hand. I do not think this is a reaction to the Ancef and therefore I think we should continue the Ancef for now and just monitor the rash and see how it goes.

He does take Ditropan XL, which has been somewhat helpful. He does do self catheterizations on a q.i.d. basis, so has recently has had a more difficult time with this as he believes he did develop some sort of a stricture in his urethra a couple of months ago.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|217|218|IMPRESSION|Somewhat concerned about possible ascending fasciitis here if it gets in the leg but right now there is no signs of that at all. Some times this becomes urgent for surgical debridement therefore I would recommend get MR today rather than tomorrow and may see more early gas shadows or problems and/or deep pockets of fluid, particularly to see if it is following a fascial plane.

Her quad screen levels were as follows: 1.12 MOM AFP, 3.10 MOM hCG, 0.83 MOM estriol, and 1.67 MOM inhibin. Her quad screen increased her chance of a baby with Down syndrome from her age-related risk of 1 in 790 to 1 in 140.
OR|operating room|OR|358|359|OPERATIONS, PROCEDURES, AND SIGNIFICANT RESULTS|Gastroenterology and liver transplant surgeons were consulted. Mr. _%#NAME#%_'s case was discussed at the liver transplant meeting, where a decision was made to place an indwelling peritoneal catheter to drain the ascitic fluid with an abdominal binder. This was suggested as a trial; however, if this trial fails, in 2-4 weeks the surgeons will take him to OR for repair of the fascial dehiscence and placement of the catheter again to control the ascites. All of these discussions and meetings were explained extensively to the patient and to his family.
OR|operating room|OR|303|304|HOSPITAL COURSE|MRSA was growing off her line peripheral blood cultures and urine so she had a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrating a large collection in the abdomen which was present on the previous studies.

US|ultrasound|US|240|241|HOSPITAL COURSE|GI was consulted to help us to manage her pancreatitis and they decided not to do any endoscopic ultrasound or ERCP during this hospitalization as she has significant evidence of pancreatitis apparent on the CT scan. We decided to hold off US and we arranged for an endoscopic ultrasound procedure for her on _%#MMDD2006#%_ with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. At that time, her pancreatitis should have settled down and it would be easier to assess any structural abnormalities, which could have caused her to have this episode of pancreatitis.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR|143|144|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|The aortic valve area is approximately at 1.0 cm2. Mean gradient of 19 and peak gradient of 31 mm. There is LVH biatrial enlargement. Moderate MR and TR pressures, however, were seen lower, which is likely related to the fact that if you add her right atrial pressure on top of the RVSP of 22 mmHg, there still would at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|150|151|PLAN|I am going to ask in he morning to have Women's Imaging specialist review her _%#MM#%_ pelvic CT.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|410|413|ASSESSMENT/PLAN|I specifically also spent some time discussing the differences between trisomy 18 and Turner syndrome, as their initial triple screen results revealed increased risk for trisomy 18 which, as you know, is a severe syndrome which includes profound mental retardation, congenital heart defects and brain malformation, from which most babies do not survive past one year of age. I discussed the specifics of their FISH results and stressed these are preliminary results. Final chromosome analysis is needed to confirm the diagnosis in their baby. I discussed options available to this couple including continuation of a pregnancy, termination of a pregnancy (up to 22 weeks in the state of Minnesota), or adoption.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|256|257|RECOMMENDATIONS|It is conceivable she may have had a brain stem stroke; even if she did, we would not utilize tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) given her marked reduced platelets and diffuse metastatic disease and so forth. Once medically stable, I would like to pursue MR imaging of the brain to look into that possibility further. The medical doctors will be looking into primary cardiopulmonary-related issues.
US|ultrasound|US|152|153|1. FEN|An anal reanastomosis is planned for 3 months of age. Pt should schedule follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ upon discharge. 5.

OR|operating room|OR|193|194|RECOMMENDATIONS|There is no acute airway obstruction at this time, stridor or retractions. RECOMMENDATIONS: Admit to the ICU for observation. In the morning the patient would benefit from being brought to the OR under controlled conditions with an awake fiberoptic intubation if possible, or otherwise tracheostomy under local anesthesia, and then panendoscopy and biopsy both to evaluate the mass, tumor map it, and make the appropriate diagnosis, then appropriate therapy can be performed.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|164|165|PLAN|I am not convinced that she has a serious degree of dementia but rather this could be primarily psychiatric disease. PLAN: Will do a neurological work-up including MR of the brain, B12, TSH, folate and calcium levels and EEG. Will get a neurology consult. At this point we will stop her Lasix which can cause tinnitus and begin Seroquel 25 mg b.i.d. as an antianxiety agent.

She was treated urgently and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. CT scan demonstrated no active hemorrhage. An MR scan revealed posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES). This was thought to be related to tacrolimus toxicity. Further, the patient was noted to go into acute renal failure secondary to her tacrolimus toxicity.
IT|iliotibial|IT|185|186|INDICATIONS|Most recently, she has had excruciating left hip pain. She has been evaluated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and referred over to Dr. _%#NAME#%_, with the thought that it may be related to her left IT band.

Once taken to the OR, he had a laparoscopic appendectomy performed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ and Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, without complications. Postoperatively, the patient was given a regular diet after he was taken back to 7B.
MOM|multiples of median|M.O.M.,|314|320|PLAN|It was explained that low maternal AFP and estriol levels, together with elevated hCG and dimeric inhibin A values, indicate an increased risk of Down syndrome in a pregnancy. _%#NAME#%_'s maternal serum sample was obtained on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, at 16.5 weeks gestation, and resulted in an AFP value of 0.79 M.O.M., an estriol value of 0.45 M.O.M., an inhibin value of 1.75 M.O.M., and an hCG value of 1.59 M.O.M. This increased the patient's risk of having a child with Down syndrome from her age-related risk of 1 in 860, to a newly adjusted risk of 1in 150 (0.7%). The clinical features and genetics of Down syndrome were reviewed with the patient.

The patient will likely need to be transitioned from her combination of PCA morphine to MS Contin, and breakthrough short-acting morphine as she was preoperatively to facilitate her mobilization after surgery. 5. Will hold antihypertensive therapy due to her low blood pressure at this time.
OR|operating room|OR|343|344|HOSPITAL COURSE|PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Aortic valve repair with mechanical valve. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50-year-old gentleman with known aortic stenosis with relatively asymptomatic but felt to have progressive aortic stenosis and thought to be amenable to surgical repair. Patient was admitted by the cardiovascular surgery service and then taken to the OR on the above-named day for the above-named procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively with an uncomplicated extubation in the immediate postoperative period.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|233|235|OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED|DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Myocarditis. OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Procedures performed while the patient was in the hospital: 1. Echocardiogram showing mildly decreased left ventricular function, hypokinetic inferior segment, trace MR, normal right side, and negative bubble study with mild left ventricular dilatation. This was done on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. 2. The patient also had a coronary angiogram performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, for chest pain and positive troponin and elevated CK-MB.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH.|233|237|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|A bone marrow biopsy in _%#MM2006#%_ showed MDS with 60% to 65% marrow cellularity, marked dysmegakaryocytopenia with 2% blasts and marked reticulum fibrosis. Of 200 metaphases, 78% had a signal pattern indicative of dilution 20Q by FISH. She has remained on GCSF and erythropoietin, and requires platelets nearly every other day. Her menorrhagia is now controlled with oral estrogens. She is now being admitted for myeloablative allo-sib peripheral blood stem cell transplant.
MS|morphine sulfate|MS|230|231|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE|The patient was continued on a morphine drip at 2 mg/hour with 1 mg boluses for pain; with that her respiratory status is normal, however there is a considerable amount of reduction in her pain. The patient usually is on 15 mg of MS Contin at home with 5 mg Roxanol p.r.n. every two hours. It seems the patient will need more medications when she goes home.
MR|mitral regurgitation|MR,|281|283|DIAGNOSES|He was admitted to the hospital with left heart failure and cardiomegaly on his chest x-ray. It was mild left heart failure but real. Echocardiogram was done and showed that the left ventricle was not dilated, EF was 25-30, visually he had mild LVH, left atrial dilation, moderate MR, moderate TR, mild pulmonary hypertension with an RVSP of 32 mmHg plus right atrial pressure. In the hospital, he was quickly asymptomatic with initial IV Lasix diuresis and he felt better.
OR|operating room|OR,|196|198|HOSPITAL COURSE|Her preoperative exam was significant for decreased sensation in her left lower extremity and some mild diffuse weakness in her left leg. After informed consent was obtained, she was taken to the OR, and had thoracic laminectomy and release of her cord. Postoperatively, she did well. She remained afebrile. Her wound remained clean, dry, and intact.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|121|122|SOCIAL HISTORY|SOCIAL HISTORY: He uses no alcohol but he is a smoker. We note that preop serum creatinine is stable at approximately 2. MR scanning of the renal arteries demonstrates a minimal right renal artery stenosis and a more moderate, though perhaps only as much as 50% stenosis of the main left renal artery.
OR|GENERAL ENGLISH|OR|203|204|REASON FOR CONSULT|Past surgical history is significant for right total hip arthroplasty, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, rectocele repair, and bilateral cataract surgery.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|204|207|RECOMMENDATIONS|These test results, in conjunction with a heart defect that is very characteristic of Down syndrome, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of fetal Down syndrome. We did discuss some of the limitations of FISH testing, and the importance of always following up FISH with a full cytogenetic study. The final results of _%#NAME#%_'s amniocentesis should be available some time next week.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH.|134|138|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|He was considered a Gleevec failure in 2006. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was started on dasatinib in _%#MM2007#%_ and had an excellent response by FISH. His positive cells decreased from 71% to 0.25% by _%#MM2007#%_. However, Mr. _%#NAME#%_ developed hypocellular marrow and acute pulmonary dysfunction.
OR|operating room|OR.|126|128|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|The patient was noted to have an intraoperative hemoglobin of 8.7 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells in the OR.

OR|operating room|OR|224|225|HOSPITAL COURSE|HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 48-year-old male who unfortunately has metastatic rectal cancer. He has undergone preoperative chemoradiation therapy. Given his ongoing disease in his liver, he is now being brought to the OR for abdominal perineal resection to resect the primary tumor, to then focus treatment more on the metastatic disease. The patient was brought to the operating room on the day of admission.
OR|operating room|OR|232|233|PLAN|ASSESSMENT: This is a 54-year-old male with acute obstructive hydrocephalus and upward transtentorial herniation resulting from a likely right-sided cerebellar infarct and the resulting mass effect/edema. PLAN: 1. We will go to the OR stat for a posterior fossa decompression. 2. We will give 50 g of mannitol stat. 3. The patient will be intubated at this time. 4. This case represents a life-threatening neurosurgical emergency and will require us to proceed at the time with the presumed consent from the patient though he is unable to give it.

He lives alone, is single, and has no children. ALLERGIES: Codeine apparently causes discomfort for the patient.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|138|139|IMPRESSION|We will keep his blood pressure under 180 on Nipride. I will consult neurosurgeon, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and his colleagues today. I will pursue MR of the brain with MR angiogram to rule out an underlying aneurysm. The patient may need a formal 4-vessel angiogram later. At this point, I do not see any need in loading him with fosphenytoin.
OR|operating room|OR|137|138|HOSPITAL COURSE|He was admitted for elective open durolaminoplasty. HOSPITAL COURSE: After informed consent was obtained Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was taken to the OR where the above named procedure was performed. He tolerated procedure well post operatively and he was managed on the neurosurgery ward.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM|120|122|G 5   P	3013				LMP|This delivery date was consistent with a 9-week ultrasound. Her quad screen results were as follows: 1.21 MOM AFP, 4.55 MOM HCG, 0.63 MOM Estriol, 3.84 MOM inhibit. Thus, this increased her risks for Down syndrome from her age-related risks of 1 in 920 to 1 in 90.
OR|operating room|O.R.|262|265|HOSPITAL COURSE|Her ABG at admission was 7.31, 76, 46, and 23.8. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken in said condition and admitted to the Medicine Service in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Her workup resulted in her eventually being taken by Cardiovascular Surgery to the O.R. where she had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure done on _%#DDMM2003#%_. Her postoperative hospital day has been significant for the following issues: PROBLEM #1: Pain control.
US|United States|U.S.|143|146|ADMISSION MEDICATIONS|ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Unknown, something for blood pressure. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient currently lives with his wife and 1 daughter. In the U.S. a year and a half from Somalia. Denies tobacco, alcohol, or other drug use. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 115/73.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|241|244|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|She continued with Gleevec, and the dose was increased to 800 mg daily; however, after one month of high-dose therapy, she experienced visual changes and confusion. Her dose was decreased to 400 mg daily until _%#MM2005#%_. In _%#MM2004#%_, FISH still revealed 27% of the cells positive for BCR- ABL, and this continued to increase. Her Gleevec was then increased to 600 mg daily, and she is now being admitted for a full prep myeloablative allogenic sibling peripheral blood stem-cell transplant.
IT|ischial tuberosity|IT|159|160|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|I was asked by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ to see the patient for internal medicine consult. Currently the patient was scheduled for debridement and flap revision of right IT decubitus ulcer but the surgery was postponed secondary to hypotension in the preop area. Apparently the blood pressure was approximately in the 80 range over 50.
US|ultrasound|US|287|288|HOSPITAL COURSE|A pulmonary consult was placed prior to possible colonoscopy. Pulmonary Consult felt that colonoscopy could be performed if needed with minimal sedation. However, colonoscopy was not pursuedas outoined above Problem #3. Ovarian Cyst -likely benign in a woman this age but needs followup US in 2 menstral cycles. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: Up as tolerated.

MR|magnetic resonance|MR|125|126|FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES|FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Two small strokes in right cerebellum, one measuring 1.5 cm and the other measuring 8.0 mm. A. MR angiogram shows short segment high-grade stenosis over a 7 mm length with maximum stenosis in the 80% range. All other blood vessels in the circle of Willis and in the extracranial circulation were normal on MRA scanning.
OR|operating room|OR|282|283|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE|3. Rituxan doses x2 for PTLD. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 65-year-old male with history of advanced PTLD presented with altered mental status and abdominal pain. He had CT scan with contrast that showed a bowel perforation. He was rushed to the OR where he had bowel resection with end-to-end anastomosis. He has extensive PTLD and received Rituxan for treatment. He, unfortunately, did not respond well.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM|158|160|G 2   P 0010				LMP|The serum screen was drawn _%#MMDD2006#%_. At the time, your patient was 15.4 weeks gestation. o AFP=0.66 MOM o Estriol= 1.44 MOM o HCG= 2.76 MOM o DIA= 2.23 MOM * Adjusted risk for Down syndrome=1:123 Screen positive * Adjusted risk for Trisomy 18=not increased * Adjusted risk for ONTD=1:10,000 * We discussed possible explanations for an abnormal serum screen including inconsistencies in pregnancy dating, normal variations in the levels of these chemicals, and the possibility of Down syndrome in the current pregnancy.
OR|GENERAL ENGLISH|OR|159|160|ALLERGIES|THE PATIENT DENIES THIS. SHE ALSO HAS ALLERGY LISTED TO ASPIRIN. CLINIC CHART NOTES SPECIFICALLY STATES PATIENT HAS NOT HAD REACTIONS WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR RASH WITH ASPIRIN USE. THE PATIENT IS UNAWARE WHAT HER REACTION HAS BEEN. UPON FURTHER QUESTIONING, THIS PATIENT STATES THIS MAY BE DUE TO BEING TOLD TO AVOID ASPIRIN WITH HER HISTORY OF GASTRIC ULCERS.
OR|operating room|OR|186|187|HOSPITAL COURSE|Total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.0, total protein 6.7, and alkaline phosphatase 79. HOSPITAL COURSE: _%#NAME#%_ was admitted for chemotherapy after he had his left knee manipulated in the OR by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ was able to flex the knee to 130-degrees in the operating room after _%#NAME#%_ had mild pain associated with knee flexion for the first day.
IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|226|227|IMPRESSION|1. This is a patient with a mechanical mitral valve in whom special precautions are needed prior to his surgery, as I have outlined in detail above. This has been outlined to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ as well, on two occasions by phone. IT is highly unlikely this patient can have surgery tomorrow, as the patient is fully anticoagulated at 2.58 and the INR can not be reversed because of the risk of valve thrombosis.
FISH|GENERAL ENGLISH|FISH,|123|127|ALLERGIES|FAMILY HISTORY: Father murdered at age 39. Mother died at 73 of diabetes and obesity complications. ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN, FISH, LATEX, CEPHALEXIN.

Married and has children. Works for U.S. Steel as an engineer. Drinks an occasional beer socially. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|127|128|RECOMMENDATIONS|We will make a decision about a needle biopsy after the PET scan is done. I agree with the neurologist that she should have an MR of the brain and cervical spine to rule out the presence of metastatic disease. We will follow the patient during her hospitalization.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|170|173|IN SUMMARY|3. Karyotype and AF-AFP results should be available in 10-14 days, at which time I will call the patient directly and fax a copy to your office. 4. The patient requested FISH studies to be performed for preliminary results on numerical abnormalities involving chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y. The benefits and limitations of FISH studies were discussed. Thank you again for allowing us to participate in Ms. _%#NAME#%_'s care.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS.|193|195|FAMILY HISTORY|No drugs. FAMILY HISTORY: Both parents died of heart disease in their upper 70s. One sister with "unusual cancer" of the neck recently diagnosed. One brother with severe arthritis and one with MS. Remainder of siblings and five children are healthy. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies constitutional complaints, HEENT or endocrine symptoms.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM|143|145|G 5   P	3013				LMP|The serum screen was drawn _%#MMDD2006#%_. At the time, your patient was 17.1 weeks gestation. The screen was within normal limits. o AFP=1.01 MOM o Estriol= 1.25 MOM o HCG= 0.61 MOM o DIA= 1.09 MOM * Adjusted risk for Down syndrome=1:2302 * Adjusted risk for Trisomy 18=<1:5000 * Adjusted risk for ONTD=<1:5000 * We discussed the fact that an increased nuchal thickness was seen on today's ultrasound.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS.|125|127|REASON FOR CONSULTATION|The patient does live in a group home setting, and the staff has been treating her fever with Tylenol. The patient does have MS. Ms. _%#NAME#%_ does deny any trauma or falls. Ms. _%#NAME#%_ states that her leg is feeling much better at this time. She state 2 days ago a nurse came to her room when she was going to give her an injection.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|290|293|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|She then underwent a lumpectomy on _%#MMDD2007#%_ which revealed tumor size 0.8 cm, Grade II/III, left sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative, and no lymphatic or vascular invasion was seen. The tumor was strongly positive for ER and PR receptor status and HER-2/neu positive (IHC 3+) and FISH was not done. She was staged at T1b, N0, Mx stage I. Because of her tumor being Grade II and HER-2/neu positive, ________ DX testing was done and revealed a recurrent score of 37 which in the clinical validation carries an average rate of distant recurrence at 10 years of approximately 25% putting the disease in the high risk category.
US|United States|US|136|137|BRIEF HISTORY|There was some difficulty getting the patient admitted to the hospital due to the patient's lack of insurance and the fact he was not a US citizen. However, he was admitted to the hospital for evaluation. The patient has a history of heart failure managed in Argentina and as an outpatient was on digoxin.
OR|operating room|OR|273|274|PLAN|The patient understands this. She desires to proceed with this approach. She understands also we probably will have to get her to a rehabilitation center for five to seven days while we contemplate revising this, because we will need about a six- to eight-hour slot in the OR and very likely will need a custom prosthesis ala tumor type, where we build up the bone rather than bony resection.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM|179|181|G 3   P	2002				LMP|The serum screen was drawn _%#MMDD2006#%_. At the time, your patient was 15.4 weeks gestation.

Depression. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Azathioprine 200 mg.
OR|operating room|OR|247|248|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Cystoscopy and proctoscopy were also performed at that time. Different treatment modalities were discussed with the patient, including total pelvic exenteration for this central recurrence. The patient desired this procedure, and was taken to the OR on _%#DDMM2003#%_, where she had a total pelvic exenteration with Miami pouch created, as well as a neovagina. She also did receive radiation treatment with iridium needles. The patient subsequently had been following up with the clinic as well as interventional radiology, as she had bilateral nephrostomy tubes in place at the time of her discharge from her previous surgery.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS|176|177|ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING|His deep tendon reflexes are 2 bilaterally. Hoffman sign is negative bilaterally. Sensations intact to light touch. ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING: A 57-year-old male with history of MS with secondary progressive disease with recent influenza A significantly impairing his functional capacity, limiting his mobility and ADLs. He also had associated spasticity, possibly chronic, and a neurogenic bladder.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|240|243|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|Because this patient was on 125 mg Lovenox, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ advised that the patient have her amniocentesis scheduled for the following day with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. When results are available, we will notify them by phone. We discussed possible FISH or preliminary results, because this patient is at 20 weeks gestation. If you have any further questions regarding this patient, please feel free to contact me at _%#TEL#%_.

IT|ischial tuberosity|IT|317|318|PENDING DISCHARGE 09/26/2007|She had a pneumonia-like picture at one point during her hospitalization at Regency and was treated vigorously with antibiotics and she gradually overcame that. She was transferred then from Regency back to Fairview Southdale Hospital on _%#MMDD#%_ and underwent extensive debridement and closure of this large right IT decubitus with wound VAC placed superficially over the partially separated incisional area to control the drainage. She has been in the hospital now over the past week with the wound separating some inferiorly but holding intact for the most part.
US|ultrasound|US|170|171|DISPOSITION|She was scheduled for another bilirubin check _%#MMDD2007#%_. Problem #4: Intraventricular Hemorrhage. _%#NAME#%_ was born at less than 34 weeks, so she will need a head US at 1 week of age. This has not yet been done at time of transfer. Problem #5: Retinopathy of Prematurity. A baby born <32 weeks and/or <1500 grams should have their first eye exam at 4-7 weeks of age.

OR|operating room|OR|198|199|REASON FOR CONSULTATION|Since doing the intermittent catheterization at bedtime, he has been able to sleep during the night but continues to have some leakage into his diaper. His wife is a nurse that has practiced in the OR in the past and is familiar with sterile and clean techniques and catheterizations, but should have one of the nurses on the floor review the catheterization techniques and observe the wife doing this while the patient is in house.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM,|302|305|HISTORY|It is explained that low maternal AFP and estriol levels, together with elevated hCG and dimeric inhibin A values, indicate an increased risk of Down syndrome in a pregnancy. _%#NAME#%_'s maternal serum sample was obtained on _%#MMDD2005#%_ at 16 weeks' gestation, and resulted in an AFP value of 0.91 MOM, an estriol value of 0.50 MOM, an inhibin value of 1.42 MOM, and an hCG value of 2.11 MOM. This increased the patient's risk of having a child with Down syndrome from her age-related risk of 1 in 890 to a newly adjusted risk of 1 in 120.

Typically, he takes MS Contin 30 mg t.i.d. and has only taken 30 mg today and thus this may also be why he is in more pain now, although normally, he doesn't have this lancinating pain.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|409|412|ASSESSMENT AND PLAN|A subsequent thorough level-2 ultrasound was performed at the Maternal Fetal Medicine Center on _%#MMDD2004#%_, which revealed this developing baby to have a left diaphragmatic hernia, nuchal fold measuring 5.5 mm, strawberry-shaped skull, bowel and liver seen in the chest, bilateral pyelectasis, fetal heart deviated into the right chest, and micrognathia. Amniocentesis was performed, in which preliminary FISH results indicate in 54% of the cells analyzed, there were 3 chromosome 21 cells, which would be consistent with Down syndrome.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|245|248|IMPRESSION|The risks, benefits and limitations of amniocentesis were described to the couple, as was the procedure-related risk of miscarriage of 1: 200. We discussed that amniotic fluid could be sent for chromosome studies, as well as amniotic fluid AFP, FISH studies for in situ hybridization could also be performed to look for common aneuploidy, such as trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and trisomy 21, and sex- chromosome abnormalities.

Of note, the patient is morbidly obese. Just after my arrival in OR the obstetrics gynecology service removed the skin staples under sterile conditions. The wound was then explored. Both Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and myself evaluated the fascia.
MOM|multiples of median|MOM.|243|246|G 2   P 1001				LMP|The screen was still reported as "normal" for Down syndrome because this particular lab uses a risk cutoff of 1:150 (rather than the usual 1:270). The risk for spina bifida was reported as "abnormal" (1:20 risk) due to an elevated AFP of 3.82 MOM. Given that _%#NAME#%_ already had a normal comprehensive ultrasound, the possibility of fetal spina bifida had previously been almost completely excluded.

MR|magnetic resonance|MR|248|249|IMPRESSION|She does have some abnormalities on EKG and I think it would be worthwhile to do echocardiogram to rule out obvious significant embolic source. At this point Plavix has been added to her aspirin which seems entirely appropriate. I would like to do MR angiography as opposed to carotid ultrasound as I believe this will give us better views of her posterior circulation. We will do an MRI brain just to see if there is any obvious acute ischemia.
US|United States|US|210|211|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|Patient did not achieve remission with that subtherapeutic dosing. She then traveled to the United States for further treatment in _%#MM2006#%_. The patient received her first round on induction therapy in the US consisting of IDA/Ara-C 3 7.

OR|operating room|OR|160|161|HOSPITAL COURSE|So, CT of abdomen was done for her, which showed inflamed appendix with a white count elevation and spiking fever up to 100.8. So, the patient was taken to the OR immediately by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and had an appendectomy. The patient had generalized peritonitis with an appendix rupture that was identified in the OR.
OR|operating room|OR|269|270|SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE|A transesophageal echo performed on _%#DDMM2003#%_ at F-UMC revealed a large mass on the pulmonary valve, roughly 3.3 x 2.9 cm, which is prolapsing into the right ventricle through the pulmonic valve. No other abnormal findings were noted. The patient was taken to the OR on _%#DDMM2003#%_ for a coronary artery bypass graft x 1 and removal of a pulmonic valve mass. A 3 cm valvular mass was removed at this time, as well as a smaller satellite lesion on the medial leaflet of the pulmonic valve.
FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|242|245|RECOMMENDATIONS|Printed information regarding unexpected ultrasound findings and congenital heart defects was given to them today. _%#NAME#%_ is scheduled to have an amniocentesis on _%#MMDD2003#%_ by Dr. _%#NAME#%_.

IT|GENERAL ENGLISH|IT|154|155|RECOMMENDATIONS|Her diabetes may be playing a role in her susceptibility to an oral infection. At this point, I think Clindamycin intravenous is the best choice for her. IT WOULD BE NICE TO USE UNASYN, BUT IN LIGHT OF HER PENICILLIN ALLERGY, THIS SHOULD BE AVOIDED. Typically, I also like to use a short course of intravenous Decadron for inflammation.
MR|mitral regurgitation|(MR)|325|328|IMPRESSION|I have told her she may well get stenting or bypass surgery as needed or as directed by our best judgment from a cardiology standpoint in view of her MR and her diminished LV function. IMPRESSION: 1. Newly appreciated cardiomyopathy, likely rather gradual and progressive in nature. 2. Moderately severe mitral regurgitation (MR) by echo. 3. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% with wall motion abnormalities, as noted above involving the anteroseptal apical left ventricle.

The patient was taken to the OR on two occasions for incision and drainage and debridement and tolerated this well. He was treated with vancomycin for the week of his hospitalization and is being discharged on the above oral antibiotics.
MR|magnetic resonance|MR|154|155|ASSESSMENT|I do not believe that the symptoms are related to vertebrobasilar insufficiency and do not believe that vascular imaging is necessary, particularly since MR angiography is not possible. Our bet can be hedged in this regard in that the patient is already taking aspirin.
MS|multiple sclerosis|MS.|134|136|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS|She in general has been feeling progressively weaker over the past one month. She has a history of frequent falls associated with her MS.

FISH|fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH|171|174|IMPRESSION/RECOMMENDATIONS|Review of results from prior pregnancy (2006): 1. Fetal chromosome studies were performed through the Mayo clinic and revealed a normal male karyotype (46,XY). Additional FISH testing was performed to rule out duplications of 22q11.2 (velocardiofacial syndrome) and this was normal. 2. Fetal autopsy revealed no abnormalities other than confirmation of the bilateral renal agenesis and "rocker bottom feet." Test results from recent pregnancy: 1.
