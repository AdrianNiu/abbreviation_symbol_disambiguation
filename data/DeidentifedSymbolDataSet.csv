Hyphen|To|132|* Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is an invasive procedure that can diagnose chromosome conditions with 99% accuracy. There is a 0.5-1% risk of miscarriage associated with this procedure.
Hyphen|Quotative or expressing a quantity or rate|173|He also has a positive Babinski sign bilaterally. Vibration is decreased in the lower extremities distally bilaterally. Light touch, however, is relatively preserved. Finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin are intact. Rapid alternating motion rate is acceptable. I did not examine gait, posture and stance because the patient just had a coronary angiogram and he has an arterial puncture in the femoral artery.
Hyphen|Lexical hyphen|101|Lungs are clear. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremity exam reveals no calf tenderness.
Hyphen|Compound|117|She was noted to have a hemoglobin of 12.6, white count of 18,900 with 85% PMNs, platelet count of 370,000. A chest x- ray on 3/19/2005 revealed a pattern consistent with congestive heart failure with mild cardiomegaly and diffuse hazy moderate pulmonary congestion.
Hyphen|Lexical hyphen|270|PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: For Past Medical History and further review, please see inpatient consultation from _%#MMDD2004#%_. In the interim, there has been no significant change. We continue our recommendation that the patient should have intermittent catheterization as in-house she has had residuals of 400 to 500. Whether or not the patient can self-cath is an issue.
Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|181|She is morbidly obese. Her incision is healed satisfactorily. There is no evidence of drainage, erythema, or rash. NEUROLOGIC: Examination does not reveal any focal deficits. Two AP-pelvis x-rays are reviewed with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. A dislocated hip prosthesis is in place. There has been disarticulation and fracture of the constrained liner, which was previously cemented into the ingrowth cup.
Hyphen|Minus|286|Her vitamin B12 level was 143. We did do a nuclear medicine red blood cell mass study which showed her red cell mass to be 55.5 ml/kg (normal 24 + or - 3 ml/kg). Her total blood volume was 53 ml/kg (normal 59 + or - 5 ml/kg), and a calculated plasma volume was 28 ml/kg (normal 35 + or - 5). Putting all of this together, this patient, in my estimation, has a contracted plasma volume which results in an elevation in her hematocrit.
Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|226|LABORATORY VALUES: Most notable for a white count of 11,800, hemoglobin 9.9, BUN and creatinine are normal at 41 and 1.86. Blood cultures and urine cultures are negative so far. IMPRESSION: Hematuria, chronic with a suprapubic-indwelling catheter. It is most likely due to trauma. There may be an element of infection.

Hyphen|Junction|177|The contribution of L3-4 is difficult to ascertain, although its central protrusion causes some effacement of the thecal sac and may cause problems with the traversing roots. L4-5 is quite degenerative with bony end plate and reactive marrow changes present in addition to the advanced degenerative disc changes.
Hyphen|Lexical hyphen|107|5. Very slightly elevated bilirubin. Will plan to check a fractionated bilirubin. I will be happy to follow-up should further issues arise. Thanks.
Hyphen|Junction|415|He plays football for the University of Minnesota and was noted to have a significant injury several days ago/week ago with a right brachial plexus injury from trauma. The patient was evaluated carefully at that time with MRI demonstrating edema and presumed stretch injury in the right brachial plexus and clinical examination demonstrated weakness from the C-5 level in the brachial plexus through at least the C7-8 level. The patient was placed in a splint and has been in physical therapy, I believe, and has had some improvement such that now his strength is perhaps 1-2/5 in these regions, at least indicating improvement.

Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|210|2. Hemoccult-positive stool with a 2-gram drop in hemoglobin. This does not, in my mind, appear to be a significant GI bleed. This is not true melena. The hemoccult-positive stool is probably coming from stress-induced gastritis or stress-induced ulcerations, as well as and in addition to her excoriated bottom.
Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|262|He did note that he has had lower extremity edema which has gotten worse particularly over the last few days prior to admission and he had a cough productive of some green phlegm which bothered him starting about a week before admission.

Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|163|HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was found to have an abscess associated with diverticulitis. She was transferred from Fairview Northland Hospital for CT-guided drainage of the diverticular abscess. Although she has had a number of CT scans, the final CT scan was suggestive that this was an abscess that could not be drained percutaneously because of the location of the abscess deep within the abdomen.

In brief, Ms. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 79-year-old lady with multiple medical problems who was being followed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ for resected lung cancer that she had in 2004 when surveillance scan showed thickening of the midesophagus.
Hyphen|Typographic convention|87|REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Modest shortness of breath. No chest pain, orthopnea is present. GI - lots of gas and eructation. No GI bleeding. GU - no lower urinary symptoms. She thinks her urine output had declined.
Hyphen|Compound|417|On transfer here the patient was found to be coagulopathic with an INR of 2.6. Initial hemoglobin was 9.0 which is around her baseline with a recheck in the morning of 7.9. Since then the patient has received 2 units of blood with hemoglobin going up to 9.3. The patient's white cells are normal at 6.7 and platelets are low at 27. The patient was also thought to have a picture consistent with DIC with an elevated D-dimer, low fibrinogen, again elevated INR and PTT. The patient had also received blood at the outside hospital.
Hyphen|To|169|No calf asymmetry. LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory review is remarkable for a recent testing including a blood gas with a pH 7.38, pO2 753, pCO2 58. Blood sugars between 100-200. Prealbumin low at 19.0. CBC with a white count of 15.0, hemoglobin 11.0. Liver function tests are normal except for an alkaline phosphatase of 193 (could be bone).
Hyphen|To|132|Respiratory effort was good. Heart rate was regular without murmur. Abdomen was gravid with a vertex fetus, estimated fetal weight 8-9 pounds. No hernia or hepatosplenomegaly was noted. No abnormal axillary lymphadenopathy was noted.
Hyphen|Lexical hyphen|167|Electrolytes normal. INR 1.68. CHEST X-RAY: Clear. CT SCAN: As mentioned above. IMPRESSION: Colonic distention of the transverse and ascending colon with an abrupt cut-off. It is likely this is just colonic ileus. By clinical exam right now he does not have an ileus.
Hyphen|Compound|284|In addition, _%#NAME#%_ reports some problems during this pregnancy with recurrent urinary tract infection, constipation and abdominal pain. She reports having visits to the Emergency Room because of this and being given prophylactic antibiotics as well as Vicodin and Colace and Peri-Colace to help treat the constipation. She also reports having a PICC line placed for treatment of urinary tract infection earlier in this pregnancy.
Hyphen|Compound|138|The patient underwent general medical evaluation with his primary care physician yesterday. He was felt to be doing well and had a chest x-ray. He was told to come in for more information. He was advised that from a medical standpoint he was felt to be a good candidate and could proceed without limitation or difficulty.
Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|232|We will tap it and have it analyzed and subsequently get a CT scan to try to further evaluate the situation. Given her low ejection fraction, a cardiac cause could be an explanation although it is unusual to get a predominantly left-sided pleural effusion with heart failure alone. Thank you very much for this consultation.
Hyphen|Quotative or expressing a quantity or rate|99|He does drink as well, though he does not quantify just exactly how much. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Twelve-point review of systems was performed and was negative.
Hyphen|Compound pre-modifiers|333|RECOMMENDATIONS: Relative to her recent stroke picture the right external carotid artery stenosis is of no clinical significance. This is not an embolic source to explain her recent left hemispheric stroke and with a widely patent common carotid and internal carotid on that side there is no indication presently for any type of left-sided external carotid artery endarterectomy. I do recommend that she remain on antiplatelet therapy and she has been started on enteric-coated aspirin.
Hyphen|Compound|59|In the emergency room, she was noted to have a sore knee. X-rays were done. Labs were also checked and it was discovered that her hemoglobin was 5.6. Felt she needed to be admitted for the above mentioned problems.

Slash|Either meaning|387|The possibility of sick sinus syndrome with contribution from even low- dose beta blockers is the best first guess as to the etiology of syncope in this gentleman, and I would be in agreement with simply discontinuing atenolol and observing making sure not to give any additional drug that might slow the heart rate. These do include Tegretol, any beta blocker, Verapamil, diltiazem, and/or digitalis.
